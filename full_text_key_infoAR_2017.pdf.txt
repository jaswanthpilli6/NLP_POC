In 2017, we celebrated our 20th 
anniversary. As we reflect on our journey 
and plan our future, we are mindful 
that our business environment today 
is more complex than it has ever been.
Almost every industry is undergoing 
major changes, catalysed by the latest 
wave of disruptive technologies. 
From virtual or augmented reality, to 
the Internet of Things (IoT), advances 
in data analytics, cloud solutions and 
more, digital disruption is building an 
exciting new future. We see the 
emergence of new industries and 
ground-breaking business models 
across all industries. The telecom 
sector is not spared. Today, we have 
to reckon with new competitors from 
outside our industry. As we evolve, we 
too are adopting disruptive technologies 
and building new capabilities quickly.
At M1, it is deeply embedded in our 
culture to challenge and push 
boundaries, be ready to quickly adopt 
new practices, and to collaborate 
cohesively and with agility in executing 
our strategic plans. These virtues have 
been integral to our success in the past 
20 years, and they will continue to serve 
us well in this rapidly-changing market. 
Since M1’s launch in 1997, we have 
built a strong reputation for our 
innovation, excellent service and 
network quality. In our short history, 
we have constantly challenged the 
status quo and stayed ahead of the 
curve in anticipating industry trends – 
first to offer nationwide 4G service, 
as well as ultra high-speed fixed 
broadband, fixed voice and other 
services on the Next Generation 
Nationwide Broadband Network 
(NGNBN). Most recently, in August 
2017, we launched Southeast Asia’s 
first commercial nationwide NB-IoT 
(Narrowband Internet of Things) 
network, the second such network 
worldwide. We are proud of our 
leadership in innovation, and will 
continue to pioneer more firsts in 
the telecom industry.
In this digital age, one of our key assets 
is network data. With advances in data 
analytics, we can obtain both macro 
and micro insights into customer 
behaviour, usage patterns, preferences 
and interests as they happen. These 
insights allow us to create increasingly 
personalised offerings, improve 
network performance and enhance 
the customer experience. In B2B 
terms, M1 is able to use our unique 
anonymised data to provide big data 
solutions to corporate customers. 
We will continue to invest in our 
information and communications 
technology (ICT) capabilities and 
strengthen our portfolio of digital 
services to transform to a Smart 
Communications Provider to capture 
new opportunities that the digital 
economy brings. Our ongoing 
digitalisation to improve operational 
efficiencies will generate cost savings 
while providing our customers with a 
seamless digital experience.
With great ambition and optimism, we 
look forward to our next 20 years and 
our role in enabling a digital future for all.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
In 2017, service revenue posted 
consecutive quarter-on-quarter growth 
to close the year at S$828.1 million, 
2.8% higher year-on-year. Fixed services 
revenue grew by a strong 24.5% to 
S$129.7 million, and this accounted 
for 15.7% of service revenue compared 
to 12.9% a year ago. This growth was 
driven by a larger customer base and 
contribution from the corporate 
segment. International call services 
revenue decreased 8.9% to 
S$55.9 million, on continued mobile 
data substitution. Operating revenue 
increased 1.0% to S$1,071.1 million.
EBITDA decreased by 3.1% to 
S$302.4 million mainly due to higher 
handset loss. Net profit after tax for 
the year decreased by 11.5% to 
S$132.5 million as a result of increased 
depreciation and amortisation 
expenses and higher interest expense.
Mobile data usage continued to grow, 
with 2017 revenue from mobile data 
increasing 1.7 percentage points 
year-on-year to 55.7% of service 
revenue. Average data usage per 
postpaid smartphone customer 
increased to 4.3GB per month in the 
fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 
3.6GB per month a year ago.
The Group’s balance sheet remains 
healthy, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 
1.3 times as at end 2017.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
M1’s total customer base grew to 
2.23 million as at end 2017.
Postpaid customer base increased 
by 45,000 year-on-year to 1.29 million. 
To cater to our customers’ growing 
mobile data needs, we launched the 
mySIM3 plans to offer more value, 
including Singapore’s first unlimited 
data 4G mobile plan, as well as mySIMe 
plans with bundled handsets. 
We also expanded our unique M1 
Data Passport service for customers 
with the launch of two new regional 
Data Passports – one for nine ASEAN 
destinations and the other for 23 Asia 
destinations. With the M1 Data 
Passport made available in 56 popular 
destinations worldwide, the number 
of M1 customers using our data 
roaming services has increased more 
than 50% in 2017, with roaming traffic 
increasing more than 150%.
For corporate customers, we made 
available M1 Enterprise Mobile 
plans in April, offering unlimited local 
messaging and voice calls, as well as 
up to 12GB data bundles usable 
across 56 overseas destinations at 
attractive rates.
During the year, we introduced two 
new digital services to enhance 
customers’ digital lifestyle. In April, 
we launched a new mobile remittance 
service – M1 Remit. Now, our mobile 
customers can access real-time 
exchange rates and remit funds 
anytime, anywhere, through a mobile 
app or a browser on their smart device. 
In September, we launched Asia’s first 
network-based mobile malware 
detection solution – M1 Mobile Guard 
to offer always-on protection.
Our prepaid customer base decreased 
by 25,000 to 747,000, following the 
shutdown of the 2G network in the 
second quarter of 2017. During the 
year, we continued to enhance our 
prepaid propositions to cater to 
customers’ changing preferences for 
digital and over-the-top (OTT) services. 
New prepaid roaming plans, with 
choice of roaming to 12 or 17 popular 
destinations, including Australia, Hong 
Kong, Japan, New Zealand and the 
United States, were launched in June. 
The M1 Prepaid Portal and M1 Prepaid 
App were also made available to enable 
our prepaid customers to conveniently 
check balances, top up and purchase 
data packs that meet their needs.
Fibre customer base increased by 
29,000 to 189,000, driven by our 
competitive service plans, tactical 
promotions and bundled solutions 
such as mesh WiFi systems.
We continued to make inroads into 
the corporate and government 
segment with major contract wins. 
This segment continues to grow 
and currently makes up around 50% 
of our fixed services revenue. We have 
also strengthened our product and 
service offerings, and capabilities in 
areas such as ICT solutions. In October, 
we launched the world’s first symmetrical 
10Gbps PON (passive optical network) 
connectivity service, as well as our 
next-generation unified operations 
monitoring centre for real-time 
monitoring of network services and 
IT infrastructure in both private and 
public clouds.
OUTLOOK
In the near term, market conditions 
will remain challenging.
The anticipated entry of new mobile 
service providers in 2018 is likely to 
ramp up competitive intensity. As a 
highly customer-centric company 
backed by quality assets and strong 
capabilities, M1 is poised to compete. 
We will continue to improve our 
services, deepen our segmented 
offerings and deliver superior 
customer experience to attract and 
retain customers.
We are well-placed to capture new 
opportunities in the IoT and Smart 
Nation space. As a leading IoT solutions 
provider, we continue to partner 
world-class solution providers to 
expand the suite of IoT products and 
services for various sectors. However, 
as it is a new technology and the 
ecosystem is evolving, mass adoption 
will take time.
Our Corporate and ICT business will 
continue to grow. We are building and 
acquiring competencies, and forming 
key partnerships with technology and 
solution providers, to strengthen and 
expand our corporate solutions, such 
With great ambition 
and optimism, we 
look forward to our 
next 20 years and 
our role in enabling 
a digital future for all

In 2017, we celebrated our 20th 
anniversary. As we reflect on our journey 
and plan our future, we are mindful 
that our business environment today 
is more complex than it has ever been.
Almost every industry is undergoing 
major changes, catalysed by the latest 
wave of disruptive technologies. 
From virtual or augmented reality, to 
the Internet of Things (IoT), advances 
in data analytics, cloud solutions and 
more, digital disruption is building an 
exciting new future. We see the 
emergence of new industries and 
ground-breaking business models 
across all industries. The telecom 
sector is not spared. Today, we have 
to reckon with new competitors from 
outside our industry. As we evolve, we 
too are adopting disruptive technologies 
and building new capabilities quickly.
At M1, it is deeply embedded in our 
culture to challenge and push 
boundaries, be ready to quickly adopt 
new practices, and to collaborate 
cohesively and with agility in executing 
our strategic plans. These virtues have 
been integral to our success in the past 
20 years, and they will continue to serve 
us well in this rapidly-changing market. 
Since M1’s launch in 1997, we have 
built a strong reputation for our 
innovation, excellent service and 
network quality. In our short history, 
we have constantly challenged the 
status quo and stayed ahead of the 
curve in anticipating industry trends – 
first to offer nationwide 4G service, 
as well as ultra high-speed fixed 
broadband, fixed voice and other 
services on the Next Generation 
Nationwide Broadband Network 
(NGNBN). Most recently, in August 
2017, we launched Southeast Asia’s 
first commercial nationwide NB-IoT 
(Narrowband Internet of Things) 
network, the second such network 
worldwide. We are proud of our 
leadership in innovation, and will 
continue to pioneer more firsts in 
the telecom industry.
In this digital age, one of our key assets 
is network data. With advances in data 
analytics, we can obtain both macro 
and micro insights into customer 
behaviour, usage patterns, preferences 
and interests as they happen. These 
insights allow us to create increasingly 
personalised offerings, improve 
network performance and enhance 
the customer experience. In B2B 
terms, M1 is able to use our unique 
anonymised data to provide big data 
solutions to corporate customers. 
We will continue to invest in our 
information and communications 
technology (ICT) capabilities and 
strengthen our portfolio of digital 
services to transform to a Smart 
Communications Provider to capture 
new opportunities that the digital 
economy brings. Our ongoing 
digitalisation to improve operational 
efficiencies will generate cost savings 
while providing our customers with a 
seamless digital experience.
With great ambition and optimism, we 
look forward to our next 20 years and 
our role in enabling a digital future for all.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
In 2017, service revenue posted 
consecutive quarter-on-quarter growth 
to close the year at S$828.1 million, 
2.8% higher year-on-year. Fixed services 
revenue grew by a strong 24.5% to 
S$129.7 million, and this accounted 
for 15.7% of service revenue compared 
to 12.9% a year ago. This growth was 
driven by a larger customer base and 
contribution from the corporate 
segment. International call services 
revenue decreased 8.9% to 
S$55.9 million, on continued mobile 
data substitution. Operating revenue 
increased 1.0% to S$1,071.1 million.
EBITDA decreased by 3.1% to 
S$302.4 million mainly due to higher 
handset loss. Net profit after tax for 
the year decreased by 11.5% to 
S$132.5 million as a result of increased 
depreciation and amortisation 
expenses and higher interest expense.
Mobile data usage continued to grow, 
with 2017 revenue from mobile data 
increasing 1.7 percentage points 
year-on-year to 55.7% of service 
revenue. Average data usage per 
postpaid smartphone customer 
increased to 4.3GB per month in the 
fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 
3.6GB per month a year ago.
The Group’s balance sheet remains 
healthy, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 
1.3 times as at end 2017.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
M1’s total customer base grew to 
2.23 million as at end 2017.
Postpaid customer base increased 
by 45,000 year-on-year to 1.29 million. 
To cater to our customers’ growing 
mobile data needs, we launched the 
mySIM3 plans to offer more value, 
including Singapore’s first unlimited 
data 4G mobile plan, as well as mySIMe 
plans with bundled handsets. 
We also expanded our unique M1 
Data Passport service for customers 
with the launch of two new regional 
Data Passports – one for nine ASEAN 
destinations and the other for 23 Asia 
destinations. With the M1 Data 
Passport made available in 56 popular 
destinations worldwide, the number 
of M1 customers using our data 
roaming services has increased more 
than 50% in 2017, with roaming traffic 
increasing more than 150%.
For corporate customers, we made 
available M1 Enterprise Mobile 
plans in April, offering unlimited local 
messaging and voice calls, as well as 
up to 12GB data bundles usable 
across 56 overseas destinations at 
attractive rates.
During the year, we introduced two 
new digital services to enhance 
customers’ digital lifestyle. In April, 
we launched a new mobile remittance 
service – M1 Remit. Now, our mobile 
customers can access real-time 
exchange rates and remit funds 
anytime, anywhere, through a mobile 
app or a browser on their smart device.

as in areas of managed infrastructure 
and security solutions, Smart Nation 
initiatives, as well as cloud and 
data analytics.
From strengthening our core 
connectivity infrastructure, building 
digital and ICT capabilities, to 
digitalising our operations, we are 
on track to transform into a Smart 
Communications Provider and build 
new revenue streams that will deliver 
growth and long-term value for 
our stakeholders.
CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
M1 is committed to responsible and 
sustainable business practices, as well 
as creating shared value for both our 
business and society at large. Corporate 
social responsibility is embedded in our 
corporate governance framework at M1. 
Through long-term partnerships and 
regular engagements with stakeholders 
and beneficiaries, we strive to achieve 
sustained positive outcomes in 
empowering individuals and 
enriching communities.
We constantly update our products 
and services to offer meaningful value 
to customers and society at large. In 
our multi-year partnership with 
Info-communications Media 
Development Authority (IMDA) as the 
appointed vendor for its NEU PC Plus 
Programme, Home Access Programme 
and Digital TV Assistance Scheme, M1 
has helped to enable thousands of 
students and underprivileged 
households to access and enjoy the 
benefits of communications technology.
In all our business operations, we act 
responsibly and ethically, complying 
with laws and regulations, and supporting 
voluntary and best practice guidelines. 
Aligning with our own business values 
and principles, our Supplier Code of 
Conduct sets out the ethical standards 
we expect our suppliers to meet or 
exceed regarding issues such as 
human rights, health and safety, 
and environmental protection.
Our people are key to the success 
of our business, and we offer every 
opportunity for them to realise their 
potential at M1, progressing their 
careers in a safe, welcoming and 
inclusive environment. Employees are 
encouraged to further their knowledge 
and broaden their skill sets through 
in-house training programmes, as well 
as external courses and longer-term 
learning such as post-graduate study. 
Reflecting this aim, the number of 
training courses attended by M1 
employees rose by 30% in 2017 
compared to the previous year.
We celebrate workplace equality and 
diversity – rewarding people on their 
capabilities and experience – regardless 
of gender, age or ethnicity. We have a 
strong culture of collaboration across 
functions, with robust processes 
and policies in place to support 
organisational growth. This enhances 
our ability to innovate and adapt to 
change. With active staffengagement, 
we align our people to our corporate 
objectives and motivate them to work 
together to achieve our goals. 
We continually review our business 
operations to identify ways to reduce 
our impact on the environment while 
still increasing productivity and 
delivering consistent quality service 
to our customers. For example, an 
increase in the use of recycled NEWater 
for equipment cooling purposes at 
various M1 sites has reduced our 
consumption of potable water, from 
100% in 2014 to 77% in 2017. We will 
continue our efforts to conserve 
resources in our networks, facilities 
and general operations.
Within the community, we continue to 
focus on our support of the arts, sports 
events and adopted charities. In 2017, 
we contributed more than S$1.9 million 
to the community, through direct 
sponsorships, donations and 
funds raised.
Since launching commercial operations 
in 1997, M1 has supported the arts as 
we believe a thriving arts scene is 
important in enriching quality of life 
and strengthening social bonds in our 
multi-cultural nation. In 2017, we were 
accorded the National Arts Council 
Patron of the Arts Award for the 18th 
consecutive year in recognition of our 
sustained contribution to the arts.
The importance we place on the values 
that are instilled by sports has driven 
our ongoing support for netball in 
Singapore. Our association with the 
sport began in 2009 and, over the 
years, we have sponsored schools and 
community netball initiatives from 
primary schools to national level. 
Combining our support for netball 
with our support for underprivileged 
children and youths-at-risk, we 
organised a charity exhibition match 
between M1 management and 
Singapore Members of Parliament in 
2017, and in appreciation, pledged 
S$50,000 to the beneficiaries of our 
adopted charities.
Further fundraising activities during 
the year raised more than S$500,000 
for these charities, while staff
volunteers dedicated their time to 
organising regular outings for the 
underprivileged young beneficiaries.
DISTRIBUTION TO 
SHAREHOLDERS
M1 remains committed to maintaining 
a sustainable dividend policy that will 
enhance long-term shareholder value. 
For 2017, the Board of Directors has 
proposed a final dividend of 6.2 cents, 
bringing total dividends declared to 
11.4 cents, representing a payout of 
80% of our full-year net profit after tax.
In determining the dividend payout, the 
Board of Directors took into 
consideration the Company’s cash flow, 
financial leverage, investment 
requirements and the resources 
available to pursue new business 
opportunities which may arise in the 
near or medium term, as well as the 
outlook on the competitive landscape 
and economy.
A NOTE OF THANKS
Firstly, on behalf of the Board, we 
would like to thank former Chairman 
Mr Choo Chiau Beng for his strong 
leadership, dedication and 
invaluable contribution to M1 during 
his three years on the Board. Mr Choo, 
who stepped down from the Board on 
1 January 2018, strategically guided 
the Company through a fast-evolving 
telecommunications market with his 
dedicated service, business acumen 
and drive.
The Board would also like to thank 
Mr Alan Ow for his dedicated service 
to the M1 Board since February 2009. 
Mr Ow retires from office at the Annual 
General Meeting on 11 April 2018 and 
will not be seeking re-appointment. 
As Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and member of the Remuneration and 
Risk Committees, he has contributed 
significantly to the M1 Board, particularly 
on audit, risk management and 
governance matters.
We welcome Mr Tan Wah Yeow to 
the Board as our new Independent 
Non-Executive Director and look 
forward to tapping his varied skills 
and deep experience.
In closing, we wish to thank our 
customers and shareholders for 
making the journey with us, as well as 
all staffof M1 who put forward their 
best at work every day, undeterred by 
the relentless pace of competition and 
industry shifts. With M1’s collective 
strength, we will forge ahead to 
strengthen our market position in the 
digital world, excited about our 
opportunities and confident in meeting 
a vibrant future.

Programme, Home Access Programme 
and Digital TV Assistance Scheme, M1 
has helped to enable thousands of 
students and underprivileged 
households to access and enjoy the 
benefits of communications technology.
In all our business operations, we act 
responsibly and ethically, complying 
with laws and regulations, and supporting 
voluntary and best practice guidelines. 
Aligning with our own business values 
and principles, our Supplier Code of 
Conduct sets out the ethical standards 
we expect our suppliers to meet or 
exceed regarding issues such as 
human rights, health and safety, 
and environmental protection.
Our people are key to the success 
of our business, and we offer every 
opportunity for them to realise their 
potential at M1, progressing their 
careers in a safe, welcoming and 
inclusive environment. Employees are 
encouraged to further their knowledge 
and broaden their skill sets through 
in-house training programmes, as well 
as external courses and longer-term 
learning such as post-graduate study. 
Reflecting this aim, the number of 
training courses attended by M1 
employees rose by 30% in 2017 
compared to the previous year.
We celebrate workplace equality and 
diversity – rewarding people on their 
capabilities and experience – regardless 
of gender, age or ethnicity. We have a 
strong culture of collaboration across 
functions, with robust processes 
and policies in place to support 
organisational growth. This enhances 
our ability to innovate and adapt to 
change. With active staffengagement, 
we align our people to our corporate 
objectives and motivate them to work 
together to achieve our goals. 
We continually review our business 
operations to identify ways to reduce 
our impact on the environment while 
still increasing productivity and 
delivering consistent quality service 
to our customers. For example, an 
increase in the use of recycled NEWater 
for equipment cooling purposes at 
various M1 sites has reduced our 
consumption of potable water, from 
100% in 2014 to 77% in 2017. We will 
continue our efforts to conserve 
resources in our networks, facilities 
and general operations.
Within the community, we continue to 
focus on our support of the arts, sports 
events and adopted charities. In 2017, 
we contributed more than S$1.9 million 
to the community, through direct 
sponsorships, donations and 
funds raised.
Since launching commercial operations 
in 1997, M1 has supported the arts as 
we believe a thriving arts scene is 
important in enriching quality of life 
and strengthening social bonds in our 
multi-cultural nation. In 2017, we were 
accorded the National Arts Council 
Patron of the Arts Award for the 18th 
consecutive year in recognition of our 
sustained contribution to the arts.
The importance we place on the values 
that are instilled by sports has driven 
our ongoing support for netball in 
Singapore. Our association with the 
sport began in 2009 and, over the 
years, we have sponsored schools and 
community netball initiatives from 
primary schools to national level. 
Combining our support for netball 
with our support for underprivileged 
children and youths-at-risk, we 
organised a charity exhibition match 
between M1 management and 
Singapore Members of Parliament in 
2017, and in appreciation, pledged 
S$50,000 to the beneficiaries of our 
adopted charities.
Further fundraising activities during 
the year raised more than S$500,000 
for these charities, while staff
volunteers dedicated their time to 
organising regular outings for the 
underprivileged young beneficiaries.
DISTRIBUTION TO 
SHAREHOLDERS
M1 remains committed to maintaining 
a sustainable dividend policy that will 
enhance long-term shareholder value. 
For 2017, the Board of Directors has 
proposed a final dividend of 6.2 cents, 
bringing total dividends declared to 
11.4 cents, representing a payout of 
80% of our full-year net profit after tax.
In determining the dividend payout, the 
Board of Directors took into 
consideration the Company’s cash flow, 
financial leverage, investment 
requirements and the resources 
available to pursue new business 
opportunities which may arise in the 
near or medium term, as well as the 
outlook on the competitive landscape 
and economy.
A NOTE OF THANKS
Firstly, on behalf of the Board, we 
would like to thank former Chairman 
Mr Choo Chiau Beng for his strong 
leadership, dedication and 
invaluable contribution to M1 during 
his three years on the Board. Mr Choo, 
who stepped down from the Board on 
1 January 2018, strategically guided 
the Company through a fast-evolving 
telecommunications market with his 
dedicated service, business acumen 
and drive.
The Board would also like to thank 
Mr Alan Ow for his dedicated service 
to the M1 Board since February 2009. 
Mr Ow retires from office at the Annual 
General Meeting on 11 April 2018 and 
will not be seeking re-appointment. 
As Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and member of the Remuneration and 
Risk Committees, he has contributed 
significantly to the M1 Board, particularly 
on audit, risk management and 
governance matters.
We welcome Mr Tan Wah Yeow to 
the Board as our new Independent 
Non-Executive Director and look 
forward to tapping his varied skills 
and deep experience.
In closing, we wish to thank our 
customers and shareholders for 
making the journey with us, as well as 
all staffof M1 who put forward their 
best at work every day, undeterred by 
the relentless pace of competition and 
industry shifts. With M1’s collective 
strength, we will forge ahead to 
strengthen our market position in the 
digital world, excited about our 
opportunities and confident in meeting 
a vibrant future.

OPERATING 
REVIEW
For 2017, M1’s operating revenue 
increased 1.0% year-on-year to 
S$1,071.1 million. Service revenue 
continued its quarterly growth trend  
to close the year at S$828.1 million, 
2.8% higher year-on-year. Fixed

1.7 percentage points year-on-year  
to 55.7% of service revenue.
Net profit after tax decreased 11.5% 
year-on-year to S$132.5 million, mainly 
due to higher handset loss, as well as 
higher depreciation and amortisation, 
and interest expenses. Net profit after 
tax margin on service revenue closed 
2.6 percentage points lower at 16.0%. 
Free cash flow decreased 17.9% to 
S$106.4 million as a result of working 
capital changes and higher capital 
expenditure. Net debt-to-EBITDA as at 
end 2017 remained healthy at 1.3 times.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
POSTPAID MOBILE
Our postpaid mobile segment 
continues to be the key contributor to 
our revenue, making up 63.4% of our 
total mobile customer base as at end 
2017 and 90.6% of our 2017 mobile 
telecommunications revenue. In 2017, 
we added 45,000 postpaid customers 
to bring our postpaid base to 1,292,000.
Driven by faster networks and devices, 
mobile data usage grew in 2017. 
Average data usage per smartphone 
customer increased to 4.3GB per 
month in the fourth quarter of 2017, 
up from 3.6GB per month a year ago.
Through the year, we continued to 
enhance and expand our products 
and services.
In February 2017, to provide customers 
more flexibility and value in using their 
local data bundles in overseas 
destinations, we launched two new 
regional Data Passports – one for nine 
ASEAN destinations and the other for 
23 Asia destinations. With M1 Data 
Passport available in 56 popular 
destinations worldwide, the number 
of M1 customers using our data 
roaming services increased by more 
than 50% in 2017, with roaming traffic 
growing by more than 150%.
During the year, we made available 
several innovative large data plans to 
cater to consumers’ growing data needs 
for social networking, and video and 
music streaming services on the move. 
In August, we launched Singapore’s first 
unlimited data 4G mobile plan, mySIM3 
98 at S$98 a month. This was followed 
in October by the introduction of our 
mySIMe plans, with subsidised handsets 
included. The four new mySIMe 
plans start from 5GB data, 100 minutes 
of voice calls and 100 SMS at S$40 a 
month, to unlimited data, voice calls 
and SMS, at S$118 a month. We also 
released our mySIMs share plan,

enabling mySIM3 and mySIMe 
customers to share their plan bundles 
with up to two other lines.
Stepping up our payment and cyber 
security service offerings continues to 
be a priority. In March, M1 customers 
gained the convenience of paying for 
purchases, from the App Store and for 
Apple Music and iTunes, directly from 
their postpaid mobile service accounts. 
To offer consumers always-on cyber 
protection, in September we launched 
M1 Mobile Guard, Asia’s first network-
based mobile malware detection 
solution. Subsequently, in December, 
we unveiled our new and improved M1 
Cyber Guardian self-help portal. 
Enhanced features empower parents to 
monitor online time and content for 
their children across all their devices.
For corporate customers, we released 
M1 Enterprise Mobile plans in April. The 
service offers unlimited local messaging 
and voice calls, as well as data bundles 
of up to 12GB, usable across 56 popular 
business destinations at 
attractive rates.
We continued to partner device 
manufacturers to make a selection of 
new handsets, tablets, wearables and 
accessories available to our customers. 
Key models launched during the year 
include Apple iPhone X, iPhone 8 and 
iPhone 8 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+ 
and Note 8, Huawei Mate 10, Mate 10 
Pro, P10 and Nova lite, LG V30+ and G6, 
Oppo R11s and R11s Plus, as well as 
Sony XZ Premium.
PREPAID MOBILE
M1’s prepaid mobile service is mainly 
used by the migrant worker community, 
transient visitors to Singapore such as 
business travellers and tourists, and 
resident customers including parents 
who want to manage their children’s 
mobile usage.
In 2017, our prepaid customer base 
decreased by 25,000 to 747,000,  
largely due to the cessation of 2G 
network and services in April. In terms 
of usage trend, we continued to see  
the substitution of traditional voice 
services including IDD by the usage  
of OTT (over-the-top) services via 
cellular or WiFi networks, as well as 
increasing preference for data-
centric services.
During the year, we enhanced our 
prepaid propositions to cater to 
customers’ changing preferences. We 
also strengthened our services and 
tariffs in addition to the distribution  
of cards and top-ups on digital and 
traditional channels.
In 2015, we enabled our prepaid 
customers to use their data bundles  
in Malaysia and Indonesia, and 
three more destinations were  
added in 2016. In June 2017, we 
enhanced the prepaid roaming plans 
with the unique feature of bundled 
voice minutes for making short 
important calls when overseas. 
In addition, we launched two new  
plans offering the options to roam  
to 12 or 17 popular destinations, 
including Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, 
New Zealand and the United States. 
These plans come with 2GB data  
and 10 voice minutes.
To meet our prepaid customers’ 
growing data needs, we launched  
M Cards that are bundled with larger 
data bundles in August 2017. 300MB, 
500MB and 2GB data were bundled 
with the S$2, S$5 and S$15  
M Card activations respectively. In 
September, we further enhanced the 
attractiveness of data bundles by 
introducing larger data packs with free 
incoming calls, such as 7-day, 2GB Data 
Packs and 30-day, 6GB Data Packs. We 
also offered two new M Card Top-ups 
bundled with more data, SMS, local  
and international talktime.
In November, we introduced a new 
Tourist SIM Card. With a validity  
period of 10 days, the S$50 Tourist  
SIM comes bundled with 100GB 
local data, 5,000 local SMS and 3,000 
local voice minutes. Besides local 
usage, tourists can enjoy 5GB roaming 
data in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, 
Malaysia and Taiwan, and up to 50 
voice minutes of international calls.
As a user experience enhancement, 
we launched M1 Prepaid portal in 
March 2017, and the M1 Prepaid App 
in November. Now, our prepaid 
customers can conveniently check 
balances, top up and purchase data 
packs on the go.
FIXED SERVICES
In 2017, we added 29,000 customers 
to bring our fibre customer base to 
189,000. This increase was driven by 
our competitive service plans, tactical 
promotions and bundled solutions such 
as mesh WiFi systems.
The majority of our fibre base are 
residential customers. They can choose 
from a wide range of M1’s home fibre 
broadband plans and value-added 
services, from the lowest priced plan 
at S$29 a month for 300Mbps to the 
ultra-fast 10Gbps plan at S$189 
per month.
The corporate fixed services  
business is a growth segment. While  
it made up 10% of our fibre base, 
the segment contributed around 50% 
of fixed services revenue for the year 
2017. For this segment, we continued 
to strengthen our product offerings  
and competencies in areas such 
as ICT solutions. In October,  
M1 launched the world’s first 
symmetrical 10Gbps PON connectivity 
service, as well as next-generation 
unified operations monitoring  
centre for real-time monitoring of 
network services and IT infrastructure 
in both private and public clouds. We 
also expanded our fibre-to-the-building 
infrastructure with full redundancy 
capability to more than 55 shopping 
malls, offices and commercial  
buildings to better manage provision  
of service end-to-end.

enabling mySIM3 and mySIMe 
customers to share their plan bundles 
with up to two other lines.
Stepping up our payment and cyber 
security service offerings continues to 
be a priority. In March, M1 customers 
gained the convenience of paying for 
purchases, from the App Store and for 
Apple Music and iTunes, directly from 
their postpaid mobile service accounts. 
To offer consumers always-on cyber 
protection, in September we launched 
M1 Mobile Guard, Asia’s first network-
based mobile malware detection 
solution. Subsequently, in December, 
we unveiled our new and improved M1 
Cyber Guardian self-help portal. 
Enhanced features empower parents to 
monitor online time and content for 
their children across all their devices.
For corporate customers, we released 
M1 Enterprise Mobile plans in April. The 
service offers unlimited local messaging 
and voice calls, as well as data bundles 
of up to 12GB, usable across 56 popular 
business destinations at 
attractive rates.
We continued to partner device 
manufacturers to make a selection of 
new handsets, tablets, wearables and 
accessories available to our customers. 
Key models launched during the year 
include Apple iPhone X, iPhone 8 and 
iPhone 8 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+ 
and Note 8, Huawei Mate 10, Mate 10 
Pro, P10 and Nova lite, LG V30+ and G6, 
Oppo R11s and R11s Plus, as well as 
Sony XZ Premium.
PREPAID MOBILE
M1’s prepaid mobile service is mainly 
used by the migrant worker community, 
transient visitors to Singapore such as 
business travellers and tourists, and 
resident customers including parents 
who want to manage their children’s 
mobile usage.
In 2017, our prepaid customer base 
decreased by 25,000 to 747,000,  
largely due to the cessation of 2G 
network and services in April. In terms 
of usage trend, we continued to see  
the substitution of traditional voice 
services including IDD by the usage  
of OTT (over-the-top) services via 
cellular or WiFi networks, as well as 
increasing preference for data-
centric services.
During the year, we enhanced our 
prepaid propositions to cater to 
customers’ changing preferences. We 
also strengthened our services and 
tariffs in addition to the distribution  
of cards and top-ups on digital and 
traditional channels.
In 2015, we enabled our prepaid 
customers to use their data bundles  
in Malaysia and Indonesia, and 
three more destinations were  
added in 2016. In June 2017, we 
enhanced the prepaid roaming plans 
with the unique feature of bundled 
voice minutes for making short 
important calls when overseas. 
In addition, we launched two new  
plans offering the options to roam  
to 12 or 17 popular destinations, 
including Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, 
New Zealand and the United States. 
These plans come with 2GB data  
and 10 voice minutes.
To meet our prepaid customers’ 
growing data needs, we launched  
M Cards that are bundled with larger 
data bundles in August 2017. 300MB, 
500MB and 2GB data were bundled 
with the S$2, S$5 and S$15  
M Card activations respectively. In 
September, we further enhanced the 
attractiveness of data bundles by 
introducing larger data packs with free 
incoming calls, such as 7-day, 2GB Data 
Packs and 30-day, 6GB Data Packs. We 
also offered two new M Card Top-ups 
bundled with more data, SMS, local  
and international talktime.
In November, we introduced a new 
Tourist SIM Card. With a validity  
period of 10 days, the S$50 Tourist  
SIM comes bundled with 100GB 
local data, 5,000 local SMS and 3,000 
local voice minutes. Besides local 
usage, tourists can enjoy 5GB roaming 
data in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, 
Malaysia and Taiwan, and up to 50 
voice minutes of international calls.
As a user experience enhancement, 
we launched M1 Prepaid portal in 
March 2017, and the M1 Prepaid App 
in November. Now, our prepaid 
customers can conveniently check 
balances, top up and purchase data 
packs on the go.
FIXED SERVICES
In 2017, we added 29,000 customers 
to bring our fibre customer base to 
189,000. This increase was driven by 
our competitive service plans, tactical 
promotions and bundled solutions such 
as mesh WiFi systems.
The majority of our fibre base are 
residential customers. They can choose 
from a wide range of M1’s home fibre 
broadband plans and value-added 
services, from the lowest priced plan 
at S$29 a month for 300Mbps to the 
ultra-fast 10Gbps plan at S$189 
per month.
The corporate fixed services  
business is a growth segment. While  
it made up 10% of our fibre base, 
the segment contributed around 50% 
of fixed services revenue for the year 
2017. For this segment, we continued 
to strengthen our product offerings  
and competencies in areas such 
as ICT solutions. In October,  
M1 launched the world’s first 
symmetrical 10Gbps PON connectivity 
service, as well as next-generation 
unified operations monitoring  
centre for real-time monitoring of 
network services and IT infrastructure 
in both private and public clouds. We 
also expanded our fibre-to-the-building 
infrastructure with full redundancy 
capability to more than 55 shopping 
malls, offices and commercial  
buildings to better manage provision  
of service end-to-end.

OPERATING 
REVIEW
For 2017, M1’s operating revenue 
increased 1.0% year-on-year to 
S$1,071.1 million. Service revenue 
continued its quarterly growth trend  
to close the year at S$828.1 million, 
2.8% higher year-on-year. Fixed 
services revenue increased 24.5% 
year-on-year to S$129.7 million,

revenue compared to 12.9% a year  
ago. Mobile data revenue increased  
1.7 percentage points year-on-year  
to 55.7% of service revenue.
Net profit after tax decreased 11.5% 
year-on-year to S$132.5 million, mainly 
due to higher handset loss, as well as 
higher depreciation and amortisation, 
and interest expenses. Net profit after 
tax margin on service revenue closed 
2.6 percentage points lower at 16.0%. 
Free cash flow decreased 17.9% to 
S$106.4 million as a result of working 
capital changes and higher capital 
expenditure. Net debt-to-EBITDA as at 
end 2017 remained healthy at 1.3 times.
As at end 2017, M1 had a total of 
2,227,000 customers, comprising 
1,292,000 postpaid, 747,000 prepaid 
and 189,000 fibre customers.

MOBILE 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
POSTPAID MOBILE
Our postpaid mobile segment 
continues to be the key contributor to 
our revenue, making up 63.4% of our 
total mobile customer base as at end 
2017 and 90.6% of our 2017 mobile 
telecommunications revenue. In 2017, 
we added 45,000 postpaid customers 
to bring our postpaid base to 1,292,000.
Driven by faster networks and devices, 
mobile data usage grew in 2017. 
Average data usage per smartphone 
customer increased to 4.3GB per 
month in the fourth quarter of 2017, 
up from 3.6GB per month a year ago.
Through the year, we continued to 
enhance and expand our products 
and services.
In February 2017, to provide customers 
more flexibility and value in using their 
local data bundles in overseas 
destinations, we launched two new 
regional Data Passports – one for nine 
ASEAN destinations and the other for 
23 Asia destinations. With M1 Data 
Passport available in 56 popular 
destinations worldwide, the number 
of M1 customers using our data 
roaming services increased by more 
than 50% in 2017, with roaming traffic 
growing by more than 150%.
During the year, we made available 
several innovative large data plans to 
cater to consumers’ growing data needs 
for social networking, and video and 
music streaming services on the move. 
In August, we launched Singapore’s first 
unlimited data 4G mobile plan, mySIM3 
98 at S$98 a month. This was followed 
in October by the introduction of our 
mySIMe plans, with subsidised handsets 
included. The four new mySIMe 
plans start from 5GB data, 100 minutes 
of voice calls and 100 SMS at S$40 a 
month, to unlimited data, voice calls 
and SMS, at S$118 a month. We also 
released our mySIMs share plan,

Key Audit Matters
How the Audit Committee reviewed these matters and what decisions were made
Revenue 
recognition due 
to complex 
billing system
The AC considered and evaluated the appropriateness of the Group’s revenue recognition 
policies. The AC, with the assistance from internal auditors, oversaw the implementation of 
the billing system which was put into effect in the first quarter of 2015.
The AC reviewed the revenue performance each quarter and compared the performance with 
that for the corresponding period of the preceding year and quarter. Management has given 
reasonable and satisfactory explanations on the variances observed. 
Ernst & Young LLP shared their approach to the audit of revenue, as part of their presentation 
of the detailed audit plan. This identified the primary areas of audit emphasis, focus and risks 
in the audit of revenue, the recognition of revenue through the billing systems and the proper 
authorisation of material non-routine revenue adjustments. 
The AC also reviewed the final audit report and findings presented by the external auditor at 
the year-end meeting.
Revenue recognition is an area of focus for the external auditor. It is a key audit matter in the 
independent auditor’s report for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. Please refer to 
page 121 of the Annual Report.
Impact upon 
adoption of FRS 
115 Revenue

The AC reviewed the disclosure on the expected financial impact on FY 2017 upon adoption of 
the new standards. Please refer to page 121 of the Annual Report. Management has given 
reasonable and satisfactory explanations on the expected impact.
Disclosure of the expected impact of the new standards in the financial statements is an area

INTERNAL AUDIT
CG PRINCIPLE 13 : ESTABLISHMENT OF EFFECTIVE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
Guidelines 13.1 to 13.5
The Group and the Company has an in-house internal audit function that is independent of the activities it audits. The 
head of internal audit reports functionally to the AC Chairman and administratively to the CEO. The hiring, removal and 
evaluation of the head of internal audit is approved by the AC. Guided by the Internal Audit Charter approved by the 
AC, the function provides independent, objective assurance and advisory services designed to add value to the 
organisation’s internal controls.
During the year, activities performed by the internal audit function include evaluations of internal control and risk 
management, as well as compliance with applicable regulations and adherence to established policies. An annual work 
plan, approved by the AC, is formulated to guide the year’s assurance and advisory activities. Audit projects are 
prioritised based on a risk and control assessment framework with the priority given to higher risk areas which are 
reviewed half-yearly.
Reports of completed audit projects are submitted to the AC for deliberation with copies extended to the CEO and 
relevant senior management officers. Key observations and recommendations are discussed during AC meetings. 
Implementation of audit recommendations is tracked and reviewed to ensure proper closure. The AC is furnished with 
a summary of implementation status every quarter.
The internal audit function has access to the AC and to the relevant documents, records, properties and personnel of 
the Group and the Company. The internal audit methodologies are aligned to the standards of internationally 
recognised professional bodies including The Institute of Internal Auditors.
The AC annually reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal audit function to ensure that the function has 
appropriate standing within the organisation and is resourced with qualified professional staff.

policies. The AC, with the assistance from internal auditors, oversaw the implementation of 
the billing system which was put into effect in the first quarter of 2015.

that for the corresponding period of the preceding year and quarter. Management has given 
reasonable and satisfactory explanations on the variances observed. 
Ernst & Young LLP shared their approach to the audit of revenue, as part of their presentation 
of the detailed audit plan. This identified the primary areas of audit emphasis, focus and risks 
in the audit of revenue, the recognition of revenue through the billing systems and the proper 
authorisation of material non-routine revenue adjustments. 
The AC also reviewed the final audit report and findings presented by the external auditor at 
the year-end meeting.
Revenue recognition is an area of focus for the external auditor. It is a key audit matter in the 
independent auditor’s report for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. Please refer to 
page 121 of the Annual Report.
Impact upon 
adoption of FRS 
115 Revenue

implementation. The AC, with the assistance from internal auditors, oversaw the implementation 
of the FRS 115 revenue recognition engine, which was put into effect in December 2017.
The AC reviewed the disclosure on the expected financial impact on FY 2017 upon adoption of 
the new standards. Please refer to page 121 of the Annual Report. Management has given 
reasonable and satisfactory explanations on the expected impact.
Disclosure of the expected impact of the new standards in the financial statements is an area 
of focus for the external auditor. It is a key audit matter in the independent auditor’s report 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. Please refer to page 121 of the Annual Report.

INTERNAL AUDIT
CG PRINCIPLE 13 : ESTABLISHMENT OF EFFECTIVE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
Guidelines 13.1 to 13.5
The Group and the Company has an in-house internal audit function that is independent of the activities it audits. The 
head of internal audit reports functionally to the AC Chairman and administratively to the CEO. The hiring, removal and 
evaluation of the head of internal audit is approved by the AC. Guided by the Internal Audit Charter approved by the 
AC, the function provides independent, objective assurance and advisory services designed to add value to the 
organisation’s internal controls.
During the year, activities performed by the internal audit function include evaluations of internal control and risk 
management, as well as compliance with applicable regulations and adherence to established policies. An annual work 
plan, approved by the AC, is formulated to guide the year’s assurance and advisory activities. Audit projects are 
prioritised based on a risk and control assessment framework with the priority given to higher risk areas which are 
reviewed half-yearly.
Reports of completed audit projects are submitted to the AC for deliberation with copies extended to the CEO and 
relevant senior management officers. Key observations and recommendations are discussed during AC meetings. 
Implementation of audit recommendations is tracked and reviewed to ensure proper closure. The AC is furnished with 
a summary of implementation status every quarter.
The internal audit function has access to the AC and to the relevant documents, records, properties and personnel of 
the Group and the Company. The internal audit methodologies are aligned to the standards of internationally 
recognised professional bodies including The Institute of Internal Auditors.
The AC annually reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal audit function to ensure that the function has 
appropriate standing within the organisation and is resourced with qualified professional staff.

CG PRINCIPLES 14 – 16 : TREATMENT & ENGAGEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDING AT 
SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
Communication with shareholders and the investment community forms an integral part of the Group’s and the 
Company’s corporate governance and commitment to transparent, comprehensive and prompt disclosure. Various 
communication channels are used to inform shareholders about the performance of the Group and the Company 
and to provide updates on pertinent developments. These include annual reports, quarterly results and other 
announcements made through the SGXNet, press releases and the Company’s website, as well as through the AGM.
Presentations given at appropriate intervals to representatives of the investment community, audio webcasts and call 
transcripts of quarterly results presentations, including question and answer sessions, are made available and updated 
regularly on a dedicated Investor Relations link (https://www.m1.com.sg/aboutm1/investors) of the Company’s 
corporate website. Up-to-date information such as the Investor Relations contact, the Company’s vision and mission 
statements and the Group structure, can also be found on the Company’s corporate website. Other useful information, 
such as the Company’s Annual reports (since 2003 to date), its Corporate Governance Report and Supplier Code of 
Conduct are also readily accessible by shareholders from the Company’s corporate website and/or our Annual Report.
In 2017, the Group and the Company continued to release its quarterly and full year results within one month from 
the end of the relevant financial period, in the form of a press release, financial statements containing management’s 
discussion and analysis of performance and outlook, and a presentation containing highlights and a review of financial 
and operating performance. Conference calls with media and analysts were held jointly immediately after the release 
of results. Audio webcasts of these events were made available on the Company’s website. Information on major new 
initiatives by the Group and the Company was also made public as soon as feasible.
The Company participated in several investor conferences and roadshows during the year, and discussions were 
based on publicly-available materials and information. The Company does not practise selective disclosure, and is 
mindful of the remedial action required to make public disclosure as soon as practicable, should there be an event 
of inadvertent disclosure.
The Group and the Company view the AGM as an important platform for shareholders to engage in interactive and 
open dialogue with the Board and senior management. The last AGM, held on 12 April 2017, was well attended by 
Board members including the Chairman, CEO, and senior management. The respective Chairmen of the Audit, 
Nominating, Risk and Remuneration Committees, and the external auditors were also all present. The Annual Report 
and Notice of AGM were sent to all shareholders three weeks prior to the last AGM, to give shareholders sufficient 
time to review the information. During the AGM, shareholders had the opportunity to voice their views and direct 
questions regarding the Group and the Company to Directors, including the Chairman and the chairmen of the Board 
Committees, as well as to the Company’s senior management.

allow for absentia voting, and shareholders who hold shares through nominees are allowed to appoint more than 
two proxies or to attend the AGM as observers. All resolutions were put to vote by electronic polling at the last AGM, 
and announcements of the detailed results showing the number of votes for and against each separate resolution for 
each substantial issue and the respective percentages were also made at that AGM and announced via the SGXNet on 
the same day. Minutes of the AGM that include substantial and relevant comments and queries from shareholders 
relating to the agenda of the meeting, responses from the Board and senior management, and the attendance of the 
Board members and senior management, was promptly prepared by the Company post-AGM and made available to 
shareholders upon request.
The Group and the Company managed ongoing communication with the investment community throughout 
the year and responded diligently and promptly to all enquiries from shareholders, analysts and other interested 
parties, through a dedicated Investor Relations team. All enquires are responded to within two working days.
M1 is committed to creating long-term value for shareholders. This is exhibited through our long-standing policy of 
maintaining a sustainable dividend payout ratio and returning excess cash to shareholders in the absence of value-
enhancing opportunities. Dividend payments have been timely and were made to shareholders within 30 days after 
the declaration of interim dividends and/or shareholders’ approval of final dividends in 2017. Barring unforeseen 
circumstances, we propose to maintain a dividend payout ratio of 80% of net profit after tax for 2018.

INVESTOR 
RELATIONS
Effective communications with 
shareholders, the investment 
community and other interested 
parties is a key objective of our Investor 
Relations (IR) programme, which we 
seek to fulfil through a series of 
planned IR activities and timely 
dialogues. Throughout the year, we 
have provided our stakeholders with 
prompt, regular and relevant updates, 
to facilitate their having an informed 
opinion of M1 and the industry which 
we operate in.
In 2017, we continued to publicly 
release quarterly, interim and full-year 
results within one month of financial 
period. All materials relating to the 
Company’s results, including 
presentation slides and press releases, 
were made available immediately on 
our website, after posting with the 
Singapore Exchange (SGX). Analysts, 
investors and the media were invited 
to join our conference calls, which were 
accompanied by question and answer 
sessions with senior management, on 
the same day of every results 
announcement. Audio webcasts and 
transcripts of these events were also 
made available on the M1 website.
Key developments for M1 in 2017 
included the launch of Singapore’s 
first unlimited data 4G mobile plan to 
cater to customers’ growing data 
needs and the launch of Southeast 
Asia’s first commercial nationwide 
NB-IoT network. The IR team continued 
to ensure all interested parties are 
kept abreast of major developments, 
through timely distribution of media 
releases and a proactive approach in 
answering related queries.
As part of our ongoing commitment 
to open communication and regular 
engagement with the investment 
community, senior management 
remained directly accessible to 
analysts and investors, providing 
them with updates of the Company’s 
developments and outlook through 
various avenues, such as one-on-one 
and group meetings, teleconferences, 
non-deal roadshows (NDRs) and 
investor conferences, both locally 
and abroad. These first-hand 
interactions are key to understanding 
analysts and investors’ views on the 
Company’s performance and strategy, 
and addressing any concerns that they 
may have.
As at 22 February 2018, the free 
float1 of M1 shares was 38.48%, with 
significant shares held by institutional 
investors across Asia, the UK and 
the USA. To maintain our engagement 
with current and potential institutional 
investors in these regions, we 
undertook NDRs in 2017 to Japan and 
the UK. Locally, we participated in three 
investor conferences, namely Deutsche 
Bank Access Asia Conference, 
Macquarie ASEAN Conference and 
Nomura Investment Forum Asia.
The IR team is easily accessible to 
analysts, current and potential 
investors who may need to seek 
clarification or provide feedback with 
regard to the Company. All email 
queries are welcomed and can be 
addressed to ir@m1.com.sg. 
Shareholders and interested parties 
are also encouraged to access the M1 
corporate website at www.m1.com.sg 
for the latest updates.
As always, the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) is an important platform for 
shareholders to communicate directly 
with the Board and members of the 
senior management team. We continue 
to host our AGMs at a central and 
accessible location for shareholders’ 
convenience. Board members and 
members of the senior management 
team make their best effort to attend 
the AGM. Our 15th AGM, held on 
12 April 2017 at the Suntec Singapore 
Convention & Exhibition Centre, was

request. The minutes included 
substantial and relevant comments

relating to the agenda of the

value for shareholders. This is 
demonstrated through our long-
standing practice of maintaining a 
sustainable dividend payout ratio and 
returning excess cash to shareholders 
in absence of value-enhancing 
opportunities. For 2017, we announced 
an interim dividend of 5.2 cents per 
share and a final dividend of 6.2 cents 
per share, bringing the total dividend 
declared to 11.4 cents per share. 
Barring unforeseen circumstances, 
we proposed to maintain a dividend 
payout ratio of 80% of net profit after 
tax for 2018.

OUR ENVIRONMENT
Energy usage
Impacted stakeholders: All
In line with the Singapore 
Government’s 2015 pledge that 
the country will become more 
efficient in its economic activity by 
the year 2030, a reduction in the 
use of non-renewable energy 
sources is a priority for M1
• 
We continually measure and review 
our environmental footprint to 
identify feasible initiatives to make 
the most efficient use of limited 
resources in a sustainable way
• 
We implement more energy-
efficient technologies
• 
Total power 
consumption of 
our operations 
increased 0.1% 
despite an 11% 
increase in new 
base stations 
deployed
• 
Minimise 
increase in total 
power 
consumption, 
despite 
expansion of 
mobile networks 
and ICT systems
Carbon footprint
Impacted stakeholders: All
It is essential to prevent our 
current actions on the climate 
from compromising the life of 
future generations. The Singapore 
Government’s 2030 targets 
towards the global fight against 
climate change also highlight the 
need for companies to reduce 
their carbon footprint and look 
towards renewable 
energy sources
• 
We have implemented new 
approaches, such as use of solar 
panels, to reduce our consumption 
of non-renewable energy
• 
We adopt new measures to reduce 
indirect carbon emissions (electronic 
equipment recycling and reduction in 
paper consumption)
• 
Launched 
e-waste recycling 
trial at selected 
M1 Shops and 
M1 buildings 
• 
eBill penetration 
at 15% (May 
2017)
• 
Roll out e-waste 
recycling 
to more 
collection sites
• 
Raise eBill 
penetration 
to 20% of 
customer base
Water usage
Impacted stakeholders: All
The supply of fresh water in 
Singapore is limited. Maximising 
opportunity to replace fresh 
water with reclaimed water is 
an important step towards 
environmental sustainability
• 
We continually seek out 
opportunities to reduce our 
consumption of potable water and 
increase consumption of 
reclaimed NEWater, 
e.g. for cooling
• 
NEWater/potable 
water 
consumption 
ratio: 23/77 
• 
Increase 
NEWater/
potable water 
ratio to 30/70

NETWORK AND SYSTEMS 
INVESTMENT (GRI IO1)
M1 commits to ongoing investment in 
new technologies, as well as coverage 
and capacity expansion, to enhance 
the performance and resiliency of 
our networks and deliver a better 
experience for our customers.
Since our inception in 1997, we have 
invested more than S$2.0 billion in 
expanding and upgrading our mobile 
and fixed network infrastructure. In 
2017, we continued to optimise our 
4.5G Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) 
and deployed 300 Small Cell/WiFi sites 
at targeted high-traffic hotspots to 
augment the customer experience. 
To catalyse smart solutions 
innovation and support Singapore’s 
transformation into a Smart Nation, 
we launched Southeast Asia’s first 
commercial nationwide NB-IoT 
(Narrowband Internet of Things) 
network in August 2017.
In enabling hyper-connectivity to 
millions of devices, sensors and 
services, the Internet of Things (IoT) 
is a key Smart Nation building block. 
With our NB-IoT network, solution 
providers and businesses can develop 
and deploy new IoT-enabled solutions 
such as smart energy management for 
buildings and homes, environmental 
monitoring, asset tracking and fleet 
management. We will continue to work 
closely with government agencies, 
technology partners, and customers to 
spur the development of more smart 
solutions in the future.

Intelligent waste management system with M1’s NB-IoT network 
M1, OTTO Waste Systems and SmartCity Solutions signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in November 2017 
to implement the first intelligent waste management system in Singapore, utilising NB-IoT technology. This initiative is 
a key milestone in support of Singapore’s transformation towards a Smart Nation.
With M1’s NB-IoT enabled solutions and IoT platform, sensors attached to OTTO’s trash containers will send out real-time 
alerts to SmartCity’s centralised management system when the appropriate level of waste is reached. This allows waste 
management companies to improve the operational efficiency of resources such as manpower and fuel by only clearing 
full containers. The waste data collected can be aggregated and analysed through M1’s data analytics platform to help 
companies further streamline their operations, such as bin distribution and waste collection frequency, enabling a 
greener environment.

Intelligent waste management system with M1’s NB-IoT network 
M1, OTTO Waste Systems and SmartCity Solutions signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in November 2017 
to implement the first intelligent waste management system in Singapore, utilising NB-IoT technology. This initiative is 
a key milestone in support of Singapore’s transformation towards a Smart Nation.
With M1’s NB-IoT enabled solutions and IoT platform, sensors attached to OTTO’s trash containers will send out real-time 
alerts to SmartCity’s centralised management system when the appropriate level of waste is reached. This allows waste 
management companies to improve the operational efficiency of resources such as manpower and fuel by only clearing 
full containers. The waste data collected can be aggregated and analysed through M1’s data analytics platform to help 
companies further streamline their operations, such as bin distribution and waste collection frequency, enabling a 
greener environment.

In appreciation of the MPs’ participation, 
M1 pledged S$50,000 to underprivileged 
children and youths-at-risk beneficiaries 
of our adopted charities.
HELPING UNDERPRIVILEGED 
CHILDREN AND YOUTHS-AT-RISK 
(GRI 201-1) 
The primary beneficiaries of M1’s 
fundraising efforts in 2017 remained 
underprivileged children and 
youths-at-risk.
The 2017 M1 Charity Golf tournament 
and M1 Bring your Kids to Work Day 
were two key fundraising events 
successfully staged during the year. 
Thanks to the dedicated support of our 
staffand families, business partners and 
associates, these events raised more 
than S$500,000 for the beneficiaries of 
our adopted charities – Beyond Social 
Services, Brahm Centre, Children-at-
Risk Empowerment Association, and 
the M1 Students Support Fund.
The M1 Students Support Fund, in 
partnership with the Ministry of 
Education, provides supplementary 
financial aid to underprivileged school 
children from low-income families. We 
increased our commitment to this fund 
by 50% and contributed to a total of 15 
primary schools in 2017 to assist needy 
students with the payment of school-
related expenses.
During the year, our staffvolunteers 
from the M1 SunCare Club continued 
to organise regular outings for the 
beneficiaries of our adopted charities, 
including visits to the movies and 
Kallang Ice World. In July 2017, M1 
presented KOOZA by Cirque du Soleil 
and invited 500 children and youths-at-
risk from M1’s adopted charities to an 
exclusive performance.
SERVING THE COMMUNITY
In celebration of Singapore’s 52nd 
birthday, M1 provided communications 
services to the National Day Parade’s 
organising and show committees at the 
Floating Platform. We also sponsored a 
stunning show-float, reflecting M1’s 
distinctive personalities and achievements 
in the parade’s Act Three segment titled 
‘Successful Local Enterprises’.
In partnership with the Singapore Red 
Cross Society, we organised two on-site 
blood donation drives in 2017 at our 
main office building. During these 
donation drives, 150 M1 staffand visitors 
donated 120 units of blood, which in 
turn will benefit about 361 patients.
The 8th M1 CONTACT Contemporary 
Dance Festival, a highlight in 
Singapore’s dance calendar, was held 
from 2 June to 7 July 2017. Curated by 
T.H.E Dance Company, this year’s 
works featured exhilarating dance 
performances, choreographic workshops 
and technique classes presented by a 
range of local and international 
contemporary dance artists. The M1 
Open Stage + DiverCity – a platform for 
young, talented and aspiring dancers to 
showcase their works, was again staged 
as part of the festival.
Our partnership with Frontier 
Danceland continues with the M1 
Dancing on the Frontier Appreciation 
Series, which introduces contemporary 
dance to students from secondary 
schools and tertiary institutions. Our 
support for this inspirational dance 
company extends to the M1-Frontier

M1 places great importance on the 
values that can be instilled by 
participation in sports, such as team 
spirit, fair play and perseverance. 
We are also keen to encourage sport 
as a gateway to healthy living. This 
drives our continued support for 
Netball Singapore’s initiatives, which 
promote netball in schools and within 
the community. M1’s association with 
netball began in 2009, and over the 
years we have sponsored a variety 
of netball programmes and initiatives 
from the grassroots to the 
national level.
Our key initiatives include the M1 
Schools Challenge League, the M1 
Talent Identification Programme and 
the M1 Age Groups KL Tour, which help 
create fresh opportunities for young 
sporting talent to excel. In 2017, we 
provided our continued support as title 
sponsor of the M1 Netball Super League, 
a local competitive event that features 
Singapore’s best netball players.
We also extended our sponsorship of 
the M1 Zone Age Groups (ZAG) 
programme. Supported by the Ministry 
of Education’s Physical, Sports and 
Outdoor Education Branch, the M1 ZAG 
programme aims to enhance the 
development of talent for the National 
Age Group Squads, and onwards to the 
National 21&U and National Open teams.
In promoting netball as a sporting habit 
for life within the corporate community, 
we presented the fifth edition of the M1 
Corporate Netball Challenge (M1CNC), 
Singapore’s biggest mixed corporate 
annual netball competition. Staged in 
November 2017 at the Kallang 
Netball Centre, the M1CNC saw the 
participation of 39 teams across a wide 
spectrum of companies. New Zealand 
international netball players, Kayla 
Cullen and Phoenix Karaka, were 
special guests at the event, as well as 
meeting with participants and fans, 
they also conducted netball clinics to 
share their experience and skills with 
young, aspiring netball players as part 
of the M1 Schools Programme.
Another highlight of the M1CNC was 
the charity exhibition match between 
M1 management and Singapore 
Members of Parliament (MPs), 
comprising Ms Low Yen Ling, Senior 
Parliamentary Secretary of Ministry 
of Trade and Industry and Ministry of

Share Grants under 2016 Plan
Under the 2016 Plan, the Company grants shares to eligible participants annually. The grant (the Provisional Award) 
represents the right to receive fully paid shares, free of charge, provided that certain prescribed performance 
conditions are met. The Remuneration Committee that administers this scheme has absolute discretion in the 
granting of shares under the 2016 Plan or otherwise in accordance to the rules of the 2016 Plan. The provisional 
award is conditional on the achievement of pre-determined targets set for a one-year performance period. The 
final number of shares to be awarded free of charge will be determined at the end of the performance period 
(Final Award).
The Final Award varies depending on the level of achievement of the pre-determined targets. An achievement 
factor will be applied to the Provisional Award to determine the final number of shares to be awarded which is 
capped at 1.2 times of the grant.
Pre-determined targets are set by the Remuneration Committee at their absolute discretion for the performance 
conditions to be met over the performance period. The targets set are based on the achievement of Profit After 
Tax and Total Shareholder Return.
The shares which are the subject of the awards will be released to a participant after the relevant vesting 
period, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, after meeting the time-based service conditions where 
the participant has served the Company or, as the case may be, a relevant associate, for a specified number of 
years. Currently, awarded shares vest over a period of 3 years. 
Pursuant to the M1 2016 Plan which were provisionally granted on 1 August 2016, the final number of shares 
which were awarded is 295,700 shares. 30% of the award will be released and vested in 2018 and 2019 while the 
remaining 40% of the award will be released and vested in 2020.
Pursuant to the M1 2016 Plan which were provisionally granted on 1 February 2017, the provisional number 
of shares which were subject to the award is up to 988,800. 30% of the award will be released and vested in 2019 
and 2020 while the remaining 40% of the award will be released and vested in 2021.
All of the 2016 Plan shares will be released to the participants at the end of the three-year vesting period. The 
aggregate number of shares to be finally awarded to the participants will be based on the achievement of certain 
predetermined performance targets and conditions as determined by the Remuneration Committee or otherwise 
in accordance with the rules of the 2016 Plan.

ENABLING A DIGITAL FUTURE

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF M1 LIMITED
For the financial year ended 31 December 2017
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of M1 Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group), 
which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2017, the statements 
of changes in equity of the Group and the Company and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and 
consolidated cash flow statement of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, the statement of financial position 
and the statement of changes of equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the Act) and Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (FRSs) so as to give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2017 and 
of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and 
changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs). Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) 
Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures 
designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of 
our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit 
opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT’D)
Key Audit Matters (cont’d)
Key Audit Matter
How the scope of our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
Revenue recognition
(a) Revenue recognition due to complex billing systems:
Refer to Note 2.22 – Revenue recognition and Note 4 
Operating revenue. 
The Group recognised total operating revenue of 
S$1,071.1 million during the financial year. New products, 
tariffs and variety of customer contracts added to the 
complexity and judgement involved in the accounting 
for revenue. 
Revenue was measured taking into account the use of 
bundling of services with handsets or equipment and 
discounts. The inherent industry risk arises from the 
complexity of the telecommunications billing systems. 
Large volumes of data with a combination of different 
products sold and price changes during the year were 
processed through a number of different systems. These 
may have an impact on the amount of revenue recorded 
during the financial year. As such, we considered revenue 
recognition to be a key audit matter.
We performed the following audit procedures amongst others:
• Obtained an understanding of the Information Technology 
(IT) and manual controls surrounding revenue systems 
and processes such as capturing and recording revenue 
transactions, authorisation of rate changes and the input 
of such information into the billing systems;
• Tested a sample of customer bills and checked these to 
cash received from customers;
• Tested end-to-end reconciliation from billing systems to 
accounting system including verifying material revenue 
adjustments passed into the accounting system; 
• Tested the allocation of revenue to separately identifiable 
components of multiple element arrangements, particularly 
in relation to transactions that include the delivery of 
handset combined with a service element in the contracts, 
as well as the timing of the revenue recognised; and
• Evaluated appropriateness of revenue recognition policies.
(b) Impact upon adoption of FRS 115 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers:
Refer to Note 2.3 Standards issued but not yet effective – 
FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Group will be adopting FRS 115 in the financial year 
ending 31 December 2018 and will apply the changes in 
accounting policies retrospectively to each reporting year 
presented, using the full retrospective approach.
Based on assessment performed to-date, management 
has disclosed the expected impact upon adoption of 
FRS 115 and the assumptions made in Note 2.3 to the 
financial statements.
We considered this disclosure of the expected impact 
of the new standard in the financial statements to be  
a key audit matter due to the judgement exercised by 
management in the determination of the accounting 
treatment under FRS 115 given its materiality and the 
volume of customers’ contracts and variations to these 
contracts such as the use of bundles and discounts.
We performed the following audit procedures amongst others:
• Obtained and documented our understanding of the 
Group’s process for implementing FRS 115.
• Evaluated management’s FRS 115 implementation by 
comparing it with the requirements in FRS 115 and related 
guidance based on the scenarios identified by management.
• Obtained an understanding of the nature of new entity 
level controls put in place as a result of the implementation 
of the new standard. 
• On a sample basis, we 
 
– tested contracts to assess whether management’s 
identification and grouping of contracts with similar 
terms are appropriate; and
 
– reperformed management’s computation of the 
accounting impact based on the identified scenarios.
• Reviewed disclosures on the impact of the adoption of 
the new standard based on the requirements of FRS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates 
and Errors.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF M1 LIMITED
For the financial year ended 31 December 2017
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of M1 Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group), 
which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2017, the statements 
of changes in equity of the Group and the Company and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and 
consolidated cash flow statement of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, the statement of financial position 
and the statement of changes of equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the Act) and Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (FRSs) so as to give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2017 and 
of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and 
changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs). Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) 
Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures 
designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of 
our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit 
opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT’D)
Key Audit Matters (cont’d)
Key Audit Matter
How the scope of our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
Revenue recognition
(a) Revenue recognition due to complex billing systems:
Refer to Note 2.22 – Revenue recognition and Note 4 
Operating revenue. 
The Group recognised total operating revenue of 
S$1,071.1 million during the financial year. New products, 
tariffs and variety of customer contracts added to the 
complexity and judgement involved in the accounting 
for revenue. 
Revenue was measured taking into account the use of 
bundling of services with handsets or equipment and 
discounts. The inherent industry risk arises from the 
complexity of the telecommunications billing systems. 
Large volumes of data with a combination of different 
products sold and price changes during the year were 
processed through a number of different systems. These 
may have an impact on the amount of revenue recorded 
during the financial year. As such, we considered revenue 
recognition to be a key audit matter.
We performed the following audit procedures amongst others:
• Obtained an understanding of the Information Technology 
(IT) and manual controls surrounding revenue systems 
and processes such as capturing and recording revenue 
transactions, authorisation of rate changes and the input 
of such information into the billing systems;
• Tested a sample of customer bills and checked these to 
cash received from customers;
• Tested end-to-end reconciliation from billing systems to 
accounting system including verifying material revenue 
adjustments passed into the accounting system; 
• Tested the allocation of revenue to separately identifiable 
components of multiple element arrangements, particularly 
in relation to transactions that include the delivery of 
handset combined with a service element in the contracts, 
as well as the timing of the revenue recognised; and
• Evaluated appropriateness of revenue recognition policies.
(b) Impact upon adoption of FRS 115 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers:
Refer to Note 2.3 Standards issued but not yet effective – 
FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Group will be adopting FRS 115 in the financial year 
ending 31 December 2018 and will apply the changes in 
accounting policies retrospectively to each reporting year 
presented, using the full retrospective approach.
Based on assessment performed to-date, management 
has disclosed the expected impact upon adoption of 
FRS 115 and the assumptions made in Note 2.3 to the 
financial statements.
We considered this disclosure of the expected impact 
of the new standard in the financial statements to be  
a key audit matter due to the judgement exercised by 
management in the determination of the accounting 
treatment under FRS 115 given its materiality and the 
volume of customers’ contracts and variations to these 
contracts such as the use of bundles and discounts.
We performed the following audit procedures amongst others:
• Obtained and documented our understanding of the 
Group’s process for implementing FRS 115.
• Evaluated management’s FRS 115 implementation by 
comparing it with the requirements in FRS 115 and related 
guidance based on the scenarios identified by management.
• Obtained an understanding of the nature of new entity 
level controls put in place as a result of the implementation 
of the new standard. 
• On a sample basis, we 
 
– tested contracts to assess whether management’s 
identification and grouping of contracts with similar 
terms are appropriate; and
 
– reperformed management’s computation of the 
accounting impact based on the identified scenarios.
• Reviewed disclosures on the impact of the adoption of 
the new standard based on the requirements of FRS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates 
and Errors.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF M1 LIMITED
For the financial year ended 31 December 2017
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT’D)
Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act and FRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient 
to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and 
transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair 
financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control.
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue 
as a going concern.

Key Audit Matters (cont’d)
Key Audit Matter
How the scope of our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter
Allowance for doubtful debts
Refer to Note 2.14 – Impairment of financial assets, Note 3 
– Significant accounting judgements and estimates and 
Note 20 Trade receivables.
Trade receivables from subscribers and accrued revenue 
are significant to the Group as they represent 11.8% of 
the Group’s assets. Trade receivables from subscribers 
amounted to S$53.5 million as at 31 December 2017.
The collectability of trade receivables from subscribers 
is a key element of the Group’s working capital 
management of which appropriate credit action is 
taken on a timely basis to mitigate the risk of exposure 
to bad debts. This is managed on an ongoing basis by 
the management.
Allowance for doubtful debts is set aside on amounts 
owing by customers based on predetermined criteria. 
Management exercises judgement in performing an 
assessment and measures the impairment loss on a 
portfolio basis each quarter based on the recovery 
percentages of each non-collection stage for both 
inactive and active accounts tracked by the debt 
management system performed by the credit control 
team. The allowance rate for each stage of non-collection 
is based on past collection trends and will be adjusted 
accordingly. Thus, we determined this area to be a 
key audit matter.
We performed the following audit procedures among others:
• Enquired management on the appropriateness of the 
model and parameters used such as historical loss rates;
• Obtained an understanding and tested Information 
Technology (IT) and manual controls surrounding the 
debt management system process and credit control 
process; and
• Assessed the overall reasonableness of the allowance for 
doubtful debts by comparing the actual loss trends across 
periods against the allowance rate applied. 
Other information
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises information included in the annual 
report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.

ENABLING A DIGITAL FUTURE

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT’D)
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont’d)
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
• 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary 
corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Ms Lim Siew Koon.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. 
CORPORATE INFORMATION
M1 Limited (the Company) is a public limited liability company, which is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of 
Singapore and is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST). 
The registered office and principal place of business of the Company is at 10 International Business Park, 
Singapore 609928.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) are the provision of 
telecommunications services, international call services and fixed services, retail sales of telecommunications 
equipment and accessories, and customer services.
2. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes 
in equity of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (FRS).
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for available-for-sale financial 
instruments that have been measured at their fair values.
The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars (S$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
(S$’000), except when otherwise indicated.
The Accounting Standards Council announced on 29 May 2014 that Singapore incorporated companies listed on the 
Singapore Exchange will apply a new financial reporting framework identical to the International Financial Reporting 
Standards. The Group will adopt the new financial reporting framework on 1 January 2018.
The Group has performed an assessment of the impact of adopting the new financial reporting framework. Other than 
the adoption of the new standards that are effective on 1 January 2018, the Group expects that the adoption of the new 
framework will have no material impact on the financial statements in the year of initial application. The Group expects 
that the impact of adopting the new standards that are effective on 1 January 2018 will be similar to that as disclosed in 
Note 2.3.
2.2 
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except in the current financial 
year, the Group has adopted all the new and revised standards which are effective for annual financial periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the financial 
performance or position of the Group and the Company.
2. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)
2.3 
Standards issued but not yet effective
The Group has not adopted the following standards that have been issued but not yet effective:
Description
Effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after
Amendments to FRS 102: Classification and measurement of Share-based payment transactions
1 January 2018
Amendments to FRS 40: Transfers of Investment Property
1 January 2018
Improvements to FRSs (December 2016)
– Amendments to FRS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
1 January 2018
INT FRS 122 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
1 January 2018
FRS 109 Financial Instruments
1 January 2018
FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
1 January 2018
FRS 116 Leases
1 January 2019
INT FRS 123 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
1 January 2019
Amendments to FRS 110 and FRS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor  
and its Associate or Joint Venture
To be determined
Except for FRS 109, FRS 115 and FRS 116, the directors expect that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations 
above will have no material impact on the financial statements in the year of initial application. The nature of the impending 
changes in accounting policy on adoption of FRS 109, FRS 115 and FRS 116 are described below.
FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
FRS 115 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers, and introduces 
new contract cost guidance. Under FRS 115, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration which 
an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new revenue standard 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.  
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of adopting FRS 115 based on currently available information.
The Group will apply the changes in accounting policies retrospectively to each reporting year presented, using the full 
retrospective approach. The Group also plans to apply the following practical expedients:
• 
For completed contracts, the Group plans not to restate contracts that are completed as at 1 January 2017.
In 2016, with the assistance of a third party consultant, the Group performed a detailed analysis of FRS 115 and has 
implemented a separate revenue recognition engine in December 2017. The Group’s nature of business involves 
primarily the bundling of services with handsets or equipment, which will have a significant impact upon the adoption 
of FRS 115 in 2018. 
A cross-functional coordinated implementation team has been established to implement the standard update related 
to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. All contract scenarios have been identified and the Group 
has implemented changes to the systems, processes and internal controls to meet the standard update’s reporting and 
disclosure requirements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)
2.3 
Standards issued but not yet effective (cont'd) 
FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (cont'd) 
At inception, FRS 115 allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone 
selling prices of each distinct good or service promised in the contract (i.e. subscription services and handsets or equipment), 
assessed on an individual contract basis. Currently, the Group recognises revenue from the sale of goods measured 
at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowance, trade discounts and volume 
rebates. With the adoption of FRS 115, revenue from the sale of goods will be recognised at fair value resulting in the 
increase of allocation of revenue to handsets or equipment at inception. Correspondingly, the service revenue recorded 
over the duration of the performance of the contract will be lower. In addition, the timing of recognition of sales commission 
expenses will also result in an impact as a substantial portion of these costs (which are currently expensed) will be 
capitalised and amortised. 
On the adoption of FRS 115, revenue recognition for handsets and equipment will increase. The Group estimates its 
handsets and equipment sales will increase by S$69.2 million and S$87.3 million decline in service revenue for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017. S$158.1 million of contract assets is expected to be recognised in the same 
period. The Group expects to reclassify S$5.4 million from trade and other payables to contract liability.
The Group pays dealer commissions for some of its contracts with customers. Dealer commissions is currently expensed 
when incurred. Under FRS 115, the Group will capitalise such commissions as incremental costs to obtain a contract 
with a customer if this cost is recoverable. This cost is amortised to profit or loss as the Group recognises the related 
revenue. Upon adoption of FRS 115, the Group expects to capitalise such dealer commissions amounting to S$5.3 million 
as at 31 December 2017 and to record a corresponding adjustment to decrease the costs of sales expense by 
S$1.0 million for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
FRS 109 Financial Instruments
FRS 109 introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets, impairment of financial assets 
and hedge accounting, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Financial assets are classified 
according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model under which they are held. The impairment 
requirements in FRS 109 are based on an expected credit loss model and replace the FRS 39 incurred loss model.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date without restating prior periods’ information 
and recognises any difference between the previous carrying amount and the carrying amount at the beginning of the 
annual reporting period at the date of initial application in the opening retained earnings. 
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of adopting FRS 109 based on currently available information.
(a) 
Classification and measurement
The Group’s debt instruments are expected to give rise to cash flows representing solely payments of principal 
and interest. The Group does not expect any change to the accounting treatment of its currently held-to-maturity 
instruments when it applies FRS 109. 
For equity securities, the Group will elect to measure its currently held available-for-sale quoted and unquoted 
equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group does not expect any significant 
impact to arise on the adoption of the new standard.
(b) 
Impairment
FRS 109 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, 
either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Group expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime 
expected losses on all trade receivables and contract assets arising from the adoption of FRS 115. Upon application 
of the expected credit loss model, with the exception of the impact on contract assets, the Group does not expect 
the standard to have a material impact on the results. The Group expects the loss allowance to increase by 
S$4.7 million in the initial period of application on 1 January 2018.

FRS 116 Leases
FRS 116 requires lessees to recognise most leases on balance sheets to reflect the rights to use the leased assets and 
the associated obligations for lease payments as well as the corresponding interest expense and depreciation charges. 
The standard includes two recognition exemption for lessees – leases of ‘low value’ assets and short term leases. The 
new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of the adoption of FRS 116 and expects that the adoption 
of FRS 116 will result in increase in total assets and total liabilities, EBITDA and gearing ratio.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date by applying FRS 116 retrospectively with the 
cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as at 1 January 2019.
The Group is currently in the process of analysing the transitional approaches and practical expedients to be elected 
on transition to FRS 116 and assessing the possible impact of adoption.
2.4 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries at the 
end of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are 
applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised profits and losses resulting from intra-group 
transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date such control ceases.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. 
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
 
–
derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date 
when control is lost;
 
–
derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;
 
–
derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;
 
–
recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
 
–
recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
 
–
recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;
 
–
reclassifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or 
loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related 
costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.
Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The 
accounting policy for goodwill is set out in Note 2.10(a).

FRS 109 introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets, impairment of financial assets 
and hedge accounting, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Financial assets are classified 
according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model under which they are held. The impairment 
requirements in FRS 109 are based on an expected credit loss model and replace the FRS 39 incurred loss model.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date without restating prior periods’ information 
and recognises any difference between the previous carrying amount and the carrying amount at the beginning of the 
annual reporting period at the date of initial application in the opening retained earnings. 
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of adopting FRS 109 based on currently available information.
(a) 
Classification and measurement
The Group’s debt instruments are expected to give rise to cash flows representing solely payments of principal 
and interest. The Group does not expect any change to the accounting treatment of its currently held-to-maturity 
instruments when it applies FRS 109. 
For equity securities, the Group will elect to measure its currently held available-for-sale quoted and unquoted 
equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group does not expect any significant 
impact to arise on the adoption of the new standard.
(b) 
Impairment
FRS 109 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, 
either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Group expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime 
expected losses on all trade receivables and contract assets arising from the adoption of FRS 115. Upon application 
of the expected credit loss model, with the exception of the impact on contract assets, the Group does not expect 
the standard to have a material impact on the results. The Group expects the loss allowance to increase by 
S$4.7 million in the initial period of application on 1 January 2018.

FRS 116 Leases
FRS 116 requires lessees to recognise most leases on balance sheets to reflect the rights to use the leased assets and 
the associated obligations for lease payments as well as the corresponding interest expense and depreciation charges. 
The standard includes two recognition exemption for lessees – leases of ‘low value’ assets and short term leases. The 
new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of the adoption of FRS 116 and expects that the adoption 
of FRS 116 will result in increase in total assets and total liabilities, EBITDA and gearing ratio.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date by applying FRS 116 retrospectively with the 
cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as at 1 January 2019.
The Group is currently in the process of analysing the transitional approaches and practical expedients to be elected 
on transition to FRS 116 and assessing the possible impact of adoption.
2.4 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries at the 
end of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are 
applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised profits and losses resulting from intra-group 
transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date such control ceases.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. 
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
 
–
derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date 
when control is lost;
 
–
derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;
 
–
derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;
 
–
recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
 
–
recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
 
–
recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;
 
–
reclassifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or 
loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related 
costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.
Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The 
accounting policy for goodwill is set out in Note 2.10(a).

Standards issued but not yet effective (cont'd) 
FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (cont'd) 
At inception, FRS 115 allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone 
selling prices of each distinct good or service promised in the contract (i.e. subscription services and handsets or equipment), 
assessed on an individual contract basis. Currently, the Group recognises revenue from the sale of goods measured 
at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowance, trade discounts and volume 
rebates. With the adoption of FRS 115, revenue from the sale of goods will be recognised at fair value resulting in the 
increase of allocation of revenue to handsets or equipment at inception. Correspondingly, the service revenue recorded 
over the duration of the performance of the contract will be lower. In addition, the timing of recognition of sales commission 
expenses will also result in an impact as a substantial portion of these costs (which are currently expensed) will be 
capitalised and amortised. 
On the adoption of FRS 115, revenue recognition for handsets and equipment will increase. The Group estimates its 
handsets and equipment sales will increase by S$69.2 million and S$87.3 million decline in service revenue for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017. S$158.1 million of contract assets is expected to be recognised in the same 
period. The Group expects to reclassify S$5.4 million from trade and other payables to contract liability.
The Group pays dealer commissions for some of its contracts with customers. Dealer commissions is currently expensed 
when incurred. Under FRS 115, the Group will capitalise such commissions as incremental costs to obtain a contract 
with a customer if this cost is recoverable. This cost is amortised to profit or loss as the Group recognises the related 
revenue. Upon adoption of FRS 115, the Group expects to capitalise such dealer commissions amounting to S$5.3 million 
as at 31 December 2017 and to record a corresponding adjustment to decrease the costs of sales expense by 
S$1.0 million for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.

2.5 
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee.
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any 
impairment losses.
2.6 
Associate
An associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies.
The Group accounts for its investment in associate using the equity method from the date on which it becomes 
an associate.
On acquisition of the associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value 
of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of 
the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities 
over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the entity’s share of the associate’s 
profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Under the equity method, the investment in associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. The profit or loss reflects the share of results of the 
associate. Distributions received from associate reduces the carrying amount of the investment. Where there has been 
a change recognised in other comprehensive income by the associate, the Group recognises its share of such changes 
in other comprehensive income.
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional 
impairment loss on the Group’s investment in associate. The Group determines at the end of each reporting period 
whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group 
calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its 
carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss.
The financial statements of the associate are prepared as the same reporting date as the Group. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

2.7 
Fixed assets
All items of fixed assets are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, fixed assets are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item of fixed asset is recognised as 
an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The initial cost of fixed assets comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase 
taxes and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. 
Dismantling, removal or restoration costs included as part of the cost if obligation for dismantlement, removal or restoration 
is incurred as a consequence of acquiring or using the asset. Expenditure incurred after the fixed assets have been 
put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, is normally recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which the costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has 
resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of an item of fixed asset 
beyond its originally assessed standard of performance, the expenditure is capitalised as an additional cost of 
fixed assets.
An item of fixed asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its 
use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset 
is derecognised.
2.8 
Depreciation
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful life as follows:
Leasehold buildings
–
10 – 30 years
Networks and related application systems
–
5 – 25 years
Application systems and computers
–
3 – 10 years
Motor vehicles
–
5 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment
–
2 – 7 years
Capital work-in-progress included in fixed assets are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The residual values, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end, and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
An item of fixed asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its 
use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset 
is derecognised.

put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, is normally recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which the costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has 
resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of an item of fixed asset 
beyond its originally assessed standard of performance, the expenditure is capitalised as an additional cost of 
fixed assets.
An item of fixed asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its 
use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset 
is derecognised.
2.8 
Depreciation
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful life as follows:
Leasehold buildings
–
10 – 30 years
Networks and related application systems
–
5 – 25 years
Application systems and computers
–
3 – 10 years
Motor vehicles
–
5 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment
–
2 – 7 years
Capital work-in-progress included in fixed assets are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The residual values, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end, and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
An item of fixed asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its 
use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset 
is derecognised.

Licences and spectrum rights
These comprise expenditure relating to one-time charges paid to acquire spectrum rights and telecommunications 
licences or access codes. These intangible assets are measured initially at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Licences and spectrum rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of 4 to 
17 years. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at each financial year-end. Changes in 
the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset 
is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in 
accounting estimates. The amortisation expense is recognised in profit or loss through the ‘depreciation and 
amortisation’ line item.
2.10 Intangible assets
(a) 
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is allocated, from the acquisition date, to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
The cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the 
cash-generating unit, including the allocated goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. 
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss 
is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
(b) 
Internet protocol (IP) address
Internet protocol address acquired is measured initially at cost. Following initial recognition, IP address is 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
IP address is amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of 15 years. The amortisation 
period and the amortisation method are reviewed at each financial year-end. The amortisation expense is recognised 
in profit or loss through ‘depreciation and amortisation’ line item.
2.11 Investments
The Group classifies its investments in financial assets in the following categories: held-to-maturity investments, 
and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation 
at every reporting date, with the exception that the designation of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
is not revocable.
Investments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs less any accumulated impairment losses. 
For unquoted equity investments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured using alternative valuation methods, 
they are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The fair value of investments that are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the 
reporting period. The quoted market price is the current bid prices. The fair value of investments that are not traded 
in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques include using recent arm’s length 
transactions, reference to the underlying net asset value of the investee companies or discounted cash flow analysis.

2.12 Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not 
at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:
(a) 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables, including amounts due from related parties, are classified and accounted for as 
loans and receivables under FRS 39.
Included in the trade receivables balance are accrued service revenue and accrued handset revenue.
Accrued service revenue relates to services rendered but not billed to customers. They will be billed at the 
following bill cycle.
Accrued handset revenue relates to revenue recognised for handsets sold with services. The accounting policy 
relating to specific recognition criteria for handset revenue and service revenue is disclosed in Note 2.22.
Allowance is made for uncollectible amounts when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect the debt. Bad debts are written offwhen identified. Further details on the accounting policy for impairment 
of financial assets are stated in Note 2.14 below.
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Such assets are initially recognised at fair value, plus directly attributable 
transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as 
through the amortisation process.
(b) 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets include equity and debt securities. Equity investments classified as available-for-
sale are those, which are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss.
After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains 
or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income, 
except that impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary instruments are recognised in 
profit or loss. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the financial asset is derecognised. Investments 
in equity instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost less impairment loss.
(c) 
Held-to-maturity financial asset
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-
maturity when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold the investment to maturity. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the held-to-maturity 
investments are derecognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.

of financial assets are stated in Note 2.14 below.
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Such assets are initially recognised at fair value, plus directly attributable 
transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as 
through the amortisation process.
(b) 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets include equity and debt securities. Equity investments classified as available-for-
sale are those, which are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss.
After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains 
or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income, 
except that impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary instruments are recognised in 
profit or loss. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the financial asset is derecognised. Investments 
in equity instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost less impairment loss.
(c) 
Held-to-maturity financial asset
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-
maturity when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold the investment to maturity. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the held-to-maturity 
investments are derecognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)
2.9 
Licences and spectrum rights
These comprise expenditure relating to one-time charges paid to acquire spectrum rights and telecommunications 
licences or access codes. These intangible assets are measured initially at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Licences and spectrum rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of 4 to 
17 years. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at each financial year-end. Changes in 
the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset 
is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in 
accounting estimates. The amortisation expense is recognised in profit or loss through the ‘depreciation and 
amortisation’ line item.
2.10 Intangible assets
(a) 
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is allocated, from the acquisition date, to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
The cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the 
cash-generating unit, including the allocated goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. 
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss 
is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
(b) 
Internet protocol (IP) address
Internet protocol address acquired is measured initially at cost. Following initial recognition, IP address is 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
IP address is amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of 15 years. The amortisation 
period and the amortisation method are reviewed at each financial year-end. The amortisation expense is recognised 
in profit or loss through ‘depreciation and amortisation’ line item.
2.11 Investments
The Group classifies its investments in financial assets in the following categories: held-to-maturity investments, 
and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation 
at every reporting date, with the exception that the designation of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
is not revocable.
Investments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs less any accumulated impairment losses. 
For unquoted equity investments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured using alternative valuation methods, 
they are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The fair value of investments that are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the 
reporting period. The quoted market price is the current bid prices. The fair value of investments that are not traded 
in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques include using recent arm’s length 
transactions, reference to the underlying net asset value of the investee companies or discounted cash flow analysis.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)
2.12 Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not 
at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:
(a) 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables, including amounts due from related parties, are classified and accounted for as 
loans and receivables under FRS 39.
Included in the trade receivables balance are accrued service revenue and accrued handset revenue.
Accrued service revenue relates to services rendered but not billed to customers. They will be billed at the 
following bill cycle.
Accrued handset revenue relates to revenue recognised for handsets sold with services. The accounting policy 
relating to specific recognition criteria for handset revenue and service revenue is disclosed in Note 2.22.
Allowance is made for uncollectible amounts when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect the debt. Bad debts are written offwhen identified. Further details on the accounting policy for impairment 
of financial assets are stated in Note 2.14 below.
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Such assets are initially recognised at fair value, plus directly attributable 
transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as 
through the amortisation process.
(b) 
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets include equity and debt securities. Equity investments classified as available-for-
sale are those, which are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss.
After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains 
or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income, 
except that impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary instruments are recognised in 
profit or loss. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the financial asset is derecognised. Investments 
in equity instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost less impairment loss.
(c) 
Held-to-maturity financial asset
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-
maturity when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold the investment to maturity. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the held-to-maturity 
investments are derecognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.

(d) 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and time deposits that are readily convertible to 
known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. These also include bank 
overdrafts that form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
2.13 Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the financial instruments. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through 
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities are set out below.
Borrowings
All borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction 
costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare 
the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and when the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. 
Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially completed for their intended use or sale. All other 
borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an 
entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Trade and other payables
Liabilities for trade and other payables, which are normally settled on 30-90 days terms, and amounts due to related 
parties are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process.
2. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)
2.14 Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been 
incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the 
financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account. The impairment loss is recognised 
in profit or loss.
When the asset becomes uncollectible, the carrying amount of impaired financial asset is reduced directly or if an 
amount was charged to the allowance account, the amounts charged to the allowance account are written offagainst 
the carrying value of the financial asset.
To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets has been incurred, 
the Group considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtors 
and default or significant delay in payments.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. The amount 
of reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Available-for-sale financial assets
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence of impairment include (i) significant 
financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor, (ii) information about significant changes with an adverse effect that have 
taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the issuer operates, and indicates 
that the cost of the investment in equity instrument may not be recovered; and (iii) a significant or prolonged decline 
in the fair value of the investment below its costs.
If an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its acquisition 
cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously 
recognised in profit or loss, is transferred from other comprehensive income and recognised in profit or loss. Reversals 
of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments are not recognised in profit or loss; increase in their fair value 
after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
2.15 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
(a) 
Financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. 
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum 
of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive 
income is recognised in profit or loss.
(b) 
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
For financial liabilities, gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised or 
impaired, and through the amortisation process.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
2.16 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition is accounted for on weighted average basis.
Where necessary, allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow moving items to adjust the carrying value of 
inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale.
2.17 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it 
is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision 
is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax 
rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance costs.
2.18 Government grants
Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be 
received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
Government grants shall be recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity 
recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Grants related to income 
may be presented as a credit in profit or loss, either separately or under a general heading such as “Other income”. 
Alternatively, they are deducted in reporting the related expenses.

The Group makes contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme in Singapore, a defined contribution 
pension scheme. These contributions are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service 
is performed.
(b) 
Employee share based payment plans
Employees (including the executive director) and non-executive directors of the Group may receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payment transactions. Employees render services as consideration for share options 
or share plans (equity-settled transactions).
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the 
equity-settled transactions on date of grant, which takes into account market conditions and non-vesting conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is amortised and recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share option reserve. The cumulative expense recognised 
at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the 
Group’s best estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expenses 
recognised at the beginning and end of a reporting period is charged or credited to profit or loss with a 
corresponding adjustment to share option reserve.

Employee share based payment plans (cont'd)
No expense is recognised for shares that do not ultimately vest, except for shares where vesting is conditional 
upon a market condition, which are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. In the case where the share does not 
vest as the result of a failure to meet a vesting condition that is within the control of the Group or the employee, 
it is accounted for as a cancellation. In such case, the amount of the compensation cost that otherwise would be 
recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in profit or loss upon cancellation. 
The share option reserve is transferred to retained profits upon expiry of the equity-settled transactions.
2.20 Taxes
(a) 
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount 
are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
(b) 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of the reporting period 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:
• 
Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and 
• 
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
• 
Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• 
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax 
assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in 
the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting period and are 
recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset 
to be recovered.

2.16 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition is accounted for on weighted average basis.
Where necessary, allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow moving items to adjust the carrying value of 
inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it 
is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision 
is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax 
rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the

Government grants shall be recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity 
recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Grants related to income

2.20 Taxes (cont'd)
(b) 
Deferred tax (cont'd)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of each reporting period.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set offcurrent 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority.
(c) 
Goods and services tax
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax except:
• 
Where the goods and services tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from 
the taxation authority, in which case the goods and services tax is recognised as part of the expense item 
as applicable; and 
• 
Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of goods and services tax included.
The net amount of goods and services tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as 
part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.
2.21 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of 
the asset’s recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating 
unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment 
losses recognised for the asset no longer exist or have decreased. The reversal is recorded in profit or loss. However, 
the increased carrying amount of an asset due to a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment 
loss been recognised for that asset in prior years. After such reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods 
to allocate the assets revised carrying amount less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
2.22 Revenue recognition 
Revenue of the Group comprises fees earned from telecommunications, international call services and fixed services 
rendered and sale of handsets and equipment.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue 
can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 
received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The 
following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
• 
Service revenue is recognised at the time when such services are rendered. Revenue billed in advance of the 
rendering of services is deferred on the statement of financial position as unearned revenue.
2. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
2.22 Revenue recognition (cont'd)
• 
Revenue from sale of prepaid cards but for which services have not been rendered is deferred on the statement 
of financial position as unearned revenue. Upon termination of the prepaid cards, any unutilised value of the 
prepaid cards will be taken to profit or loss.
• 
Revenue from sale of handset and equipment is recognised upon the transfer of significant risk and reward 
of the handset and equipment to the customer which generally coincides with delivery and acceptance of the 
handsets and equipment sold.
• 
Revenue on award credits are recognised based on the number of award credits that have been redeemed in 
exchange for free or discounted goods and services, relative to the total numbers of awards expected to be redeemed.
• 
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method.
2.23 Customer acquisition costs
Customer acquisition costs are accounted for in profit or loss when incurred.
2.24 Operating leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The aggregate benefit of incentives provided by the lessor is recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the 
lease term on a straight-line basis.
2.25 Foreign currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is also the Company and 
subsidiary companies’ functional currencies.
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries 
and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at the 
transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the end of 
the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.
2.26 Segment reporting
The Company and its subsidiaries operate in Singapore in one business segment, that of provision of telecommunications 
services, international call services and fixed services, retail sales of telecommunications equipment and accessories, 
and customer services.
2.27 Share capital and share issuance expenses
Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as share capital in equity.
2.28 Treasury shares
The Group’s own equity instruments, which are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from 
equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity 
instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount of treasury shares and the consideration received, if reissued, 
is recognised directly in equity. Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and no dividends are 
allocated to them respectively.

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of

unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment 
losses recognised for the asset no longer exist or have decreased. The reversal is recorded in profit or loss. However, 
the increased carrying amount of an asset due to a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment 
loss been recognised for that asset in prior years. After such reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods

Revenue of the Group comprises fees earned from telecommunications, international call services and fixed services 
rendered and sale of handsets and equipment.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue 
can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 
received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. The

subsidiary companies’ functional currencies.
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries 
and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at the 
transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the end of 
the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.

2.20 Taxes (cont'd)
(b) 
Deferred tax (cont'd)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of each reporting period.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set offcurrent 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority.
(c) 
Goods and services tax
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax except:
• 
Where the goods and services tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from 
the taxation authority, in which case the goods and services tax is recognised as part of the expense item 
as applicable; and 
• 
Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of goods and services tax included.
The net amount of goods and services tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as 
part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.
2.21 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of 
the asset’s recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating 
unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment 
losses recognised for the asset no longer exist or have decreased. The reversal is recorded in profit or loss. However, 
the increased carrying amount of an asset due to a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment 
loss been recognised for that asset in prior years. After such reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods 
to allocate the assets revised carrying amount less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
2.22 Revenue recognition 
Revenue of the Group comprises fees earned from telecommunications, international call services and fixed services

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
2.29 Contingencies
A contingent liability is:
(a) 
a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or
(b) 
a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
(i) 
It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation; or
(ii) 
The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. 
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair values can be reliably determined.
3. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or 
liability affected in the future periods.
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of each 
reporting period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available 
when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, 
however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes 
are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
• 
Useful lives of network and related application systems
The cost of network and related application systems is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the assets’ 
estimated economic useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives of these fixed assets to be within 
5 to 25 years. These are common life expectancies applied in the telecommunications industry. Changes in the 
expected level of usage and technological developments could impact the economic useful life and the residual 
values of these assets, therefore, future depreciation charges could be revised. The carrying amounts of the 
Group’s and Company’s network and related application systems at the end of the reporting period are disclosed 
in Note 11 to the financial statements.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s carrying amount of the network and related application systems stated at net book value as at 
31 December 2017 was S$516,683,000 (2016: S$551,748,000). If the useful lives of the network and related 
systems increased by 5%, the carrying amount of the network and related application systems for the Group 
will increase by S$3,892,000 (2016: S$3,837,000) and the carrying amount of the network and related application 
systems for the Company will increase by S$3,875,000 (2016: S$3,831,000).
If the useful lives of the network and related systems decreased by 5%, the carrying amount of the network and 
related application systems for the Group will decrease by S$4,301,000 (2016: S$4,241,000) and the carrying amount 
of the network and related application systems for the Company will decrease by S$4,283,000 (2016: S$4,234,000).

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONT’D)
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty (cont'd)
• 
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting 
date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from 
the asset or cash-generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of 
those cash flows. Further details of the key assumptions applied in the impairment assessment of goodwill are 
given in Note 13 to the financial statements.
• 
Impairment of loans and receivables
The Group and the Company assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence 
that a financial asset is impaired. Factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties 
of the debtor and default or significant delay in payments are objective evidence of impairment. In determining 
whether there is objective evidence of impairment, the Group considers whether there is observable data 
indicating that there have been significant changes in the debtor’s payment ability or whether there have been 
significant changes with adverse effect in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which 
the debtor operates in.
Where there is objective evidence of impairment, the amount and timing of future cash flows are estimated 
based on historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. Actual results may differ 
from management’s estimates. The carrying amounts of the Group’s and the Company’s loans and receivables 
at the end of the reporting period are disclosed in Note 32 to the financial statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
2.29 Contingencies
A contingent liability is:
(a) 
a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or
(b) 
a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
(i) 
It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation; or
(ii) 
The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. 
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair values can be reliably determined.
3. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or 
liability affected in the future periods.
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of each 
reporting period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available 
when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, 
however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes 
are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
• 
Useful lives of network and related application systems
The cost of network and related application systems is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the assets’ 
estimated economic useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives of these fixed assets to be within 
5 to 25 years. These are common life expectancies applied in the telecommunications industry. Changes in the 
expected level of usage and technological developments could impact the economic useful life and the residual 
values of these assets, therefore, future depreciation charges could be revised. The carrying amounts of the 
Group’s and Company’s network and related application systems at the end of the reporting period are disclosed 
in Note 11 to the financial statements.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s carrying amount of the network and related application systems stated at net book value as at 
31 December 2017 was S$516,683,000 (2016: S$551,748,000). If the useful lives of the network and related 
systems increased by 5%, the carrying amount of the network and related application systems for the Group 
will increase by S$3,892,000 (2016: S$3,837,000) and the carrying amount of the network and related application 
systems for the Company will increase by S$3,875,000 (2016: S$3,831,000).
If the useful lives of the network and related systems decreased by 5%, the carrying amount of the network and 
related application systems for the Group will decrease by S$4,301,000 (2016: S$4,241,000) and the carrying amount 
of the network and related application systems for the Company will decrease by S$4,283,000 (2016: S$4,234,000).

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the financial year. Diluted earnings per share 
is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares on issue during the financial year (adjusted for effects of dilutive share options).
The following reflects the earnings and share data used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share

Impairment testing of goodwill
The Group previously, acquired a 100% equity interest in M1 Connect Pte. Ltd. (M1 Connect). Subsequently, the Group 
has transferred M1 Connect’s broadband business to another wholly owned subsidiary, M1 Net Ltd. (M1 Net). 
Management has allocated the goodwill to M1 Net as a cash-generating unit (CGU) for impairment testing. The recoverable 
amount of the CGU has been determined based on value in use calculations using cash flow projections covering a 
five-year period. The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections and terminal growth rate used to extrapolate 
cash flow projections beyond the five-year period are 8% (2016: 8%) and Nil (2016: Nil) respectively.
The calculation of value in use for the CGU is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
Terminal growth rate – The terminal growth rate used does not exceed the long term average growth rate of the industry 
and country in which the CGU operates.
Discount rate applied should reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to the CGU.
No impairment loss (2016: Nil) was recognised in profit or loss.
A reasonable change to the assumptions used by the management to determine the impairment required, particularly 
the discount rate and terminal growth rate, would not significantly affect the results.

the measurement of fair value.
 
(b) 
Share plan
The M1 Share Plan 2016 (2016 Plan) was approved by shareholders in Annual General Meeting on 6 April 2016. 
Under the 2016 Plan, the aggregate number of shares which are fully paid to be finally awarded to the participants 
free of charge will be based on the achievement of certain predetermined performance targets and conditions as 
determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the performance period (Final Award).
The Final Award varies depending on the level of achievement of the pre-determined targets. An achievement 
factor will be applied to the Provisional Award to determine the final number of shares to be awarded which is 
capped at 1.2 times of the grant.
Pre-determined targets are set by the Remuneration Committee at their absolute discretion for the performance 
conditions to be met over the performance period. The targets set are based on the achievement of Profit After 
Tax and Total Shareholder Return.
The shares which are the subject of the awards will be released to a participant after the relevant vesting period, 
as determined by the Remuneration Committee, after meeting the time-based service conditions where the 
participant has served the Company or, as the case may be, a relevant associate, for a specified number of years. 
Currently, awarded shares vest over a period of 3 years.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT’D)
 
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s revenue and expenditure are primarily transacted in Singapore dollars. The currency exposures are mainly 
limited to Special Drawing Rights (SDR). SDR is an international reserve asset created by International Monetary Fund 
and is valued on the basis of a basket of key national currencies.
The Group is also exposed to currency translation risk arising from its investment securities denominated in USD 
and HKD.
The Group and the Company also hold cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies for working capital 
purposes as disclosed in Note 22.
Whenever possible, foreign currency transactions are matched to minimise the exposure. The exchange rates are 
continually monitored and forward contracts are used when appropriate to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations.
 
Market price risk
Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments will fluctuate 
because of changes in market prices (other than interest or exchange rates). The Group is exposed to equity price 
risk arising from its investment in quoted equity securities. These quoted equity securities are quoted on the Growth 
Enterprise Market, set up by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. 
The Group does not have exposure to commodity price risk.
Sensitivity analysis for equity price risk
At the end of the reporting period, if the price per share had been 5% (2016: 5%) higher/lower with all other variables 
held constant, the Group’s other comprehensive income would have been S$125,000 (2016: S$102,000) higher/lower, 
arising as a result of an increase/decrease in the share price of investment in quoted equity securities.
31. 
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group categorises fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs 
used as follows:
 
–
Level 1 –  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access 
at the measurement date,
 
–
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly, and
 
–
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the same level of 
the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT’D)
 
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s revenue and expenditure are primarily transacted in Singapore dollars. The currency exposures are mainly 
limited to Special Drawing Rights (SDR). SDR is an international reserve asset created by International Monetary Fund 
and is valued on the basis of a basket of key national currencies.
The Group is also exposed to currency translation risk arising from its investment securities denominated in USD 
and HKD.
The Group and the Company also hold cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies for working capital 
purposes as disclosed in Note 22.
Whenever possible, foreign currency transactions are matched to minimise the exposure. The exchange rates are 
continually monitored and forward contracts are used when appropriate to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations.
 
Market price risk
Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments will fluctuate 
because of changes in market prices (other than interest or exchange rates). The Group is exposed to equity price 
risk arising from its investment in quoted equity securities. These quoted equity securities are quoted on the Growth 
Enterprise Market, set up by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. 
The Group does not have exposure to commodity price risk.
Sensitivity analysis for equity price risk
At the end of the reporting period, if the price per share had been 5% (2016: 5%) higher/lower with all other variables 
held constant, the Group’s other comprehensive income would have been S$125,000 (2016: S$102,000) higher/lower, 
arising as a result of an increase/decrease in the share price of investment in quoted equity securities.
31. 
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group categorises fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs 
used as follows:
 
–
Level 1 –  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access 
at the measurement date,
 
–
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly, and
 
–
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the same level of 
the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
