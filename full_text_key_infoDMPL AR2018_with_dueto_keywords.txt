DMPL’s fiscal year ends in April in line with its USA subsidiary Del Monte Foods, Inc. For 2013, fiscal year was ending December.
2 
DMPL adopted amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 (Agriculture: Bearer Plants in April 2017). The change in accounting standard was applied retrospectively. 
This involved reclassifying a portion of biological assets to plant, property and equipment leading to much higher depreciation expense. However, for EBITDA 
calculation, the Group retained the old calculation using the lower depreciation for comparability.
3 
The profitability of the Group from CY2013-FY2018 had been impacted by non-recurring items mostly in the USA. Please refer to the Operating and Financial 
Review section for more details.
4 
EPS is calculated as earnings after preference share dividends resulting in a negative figure in FY2018.
5 
DMPL ordinary shares were listed on 2 August 1999 on the Singapore Exchange and on 10 June 2013 on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). Singapore share 
prices are converted to US cents for the purpose of computing financial ratios. DMPL did a 2:10 Bonus Issue with ex-date of 9 April 2013. It also did a Rights 
Issue in March 2015. New shares issued resulted in a 33% dilution.

Preference Shares started trading on the PSE on 7 April 2017 for Series A-1 and on 15 December 2017 for Series A-2.

ANNUAL REPORT FY2018

LETTER TO
SHAREHOLDERS
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
In FY2018, we focused 
on three key areas – 
deleveraging the balance 
sheet, strengthening 
our core business and 
innovating products and 
processes.
DELEVERAGING THE 
BALANCE SHEET
Since our leveraged 
acquisition of the 
consumer food business 
of Del Monte in the USA, 
we have raised about 
US$450 million of equity 
for debt repayment, of 
which we raised nearly 
US$300 million in April 
and December 2017 by 
issuing the first US dollar 
denominated Preference 
Shares listed on the 
Philippine Stock Exchange 
(PSE). We raised US$150 
million of capital through a 
Rights Issue in 2015.
Secondly, as of April 2018, 
we purchased US$125 
million of loans in the 
USA that has yielded 
significant principal and 
interest savings. These 
loans had been trading at 
a substantial discount to 
par value in the secondary 
market and are the highest 
interest-bearing credit 
facility of the Group. 
Finally, our Group 
significantly improved 
our operating cash flow 
to US$322.9 million in 
FY2018 from US$187.1 
million in the prior year, 
primarily by reducing 
inventory in the USA.
As a result of all these 
initiatives we have 
executed, we reduced 
our net debt at the end of 
FY2018 to US$1.4 billion, 
much lower than US$1.7 
billion at the end of the 
prior year. 
We ended FY2018 with a 
net debt to equity ratio of 
2.4x, a reduction from 2.9x 
in the prior year, and more 
significantly, 7.5x four 
years ago post-acquisition.
To further improve our 
capital structure, we plan 
to sell about 20% of our 
stake in our wholly-owned 
subsidiary, Del Monte 
Philippines, Inc (DMPI), 
through a public offering 
on the PSE. Proceeds 
will be used for loan 
repayment which will 
strengthen our balance 
sheet further and also 
improve our profitability 
with lower interest 
expense. This capital-
raising will also unlock 
the value of our subsidiary 
and the Group as a 
whole, creating immense 
benefit to DMPL and our 
shareholders, as well as 
to DMPI. We deferred 
the planned IPO in June 
2018, as advised by our 
underwriters, due to 
volatile market conditions, 
and will update the public 
about the relaunch under 
more favourable equity 
markets.
STRENGTHENING OUR 
CORE BUSINESS
With our US business 
generating 75% of Group 
sales, it is imperative 
that we have the right 
leadership to steer it 
to profit and sustained 
growth. In FY2018, we 
strengthened our US 
leadership team with 
the appointment of a 
new Del Monte Foods, 
Inc (DMFI) CEO, Chief 
Marketing Offi  cer, and 
Heads of Operations and 
Foodservice.

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED
ANNUAL REPORT FY2018

Our new DMFI CEO 
Gregory Longstreet joined 
us in September 2017. 
He has over 25 years of 
work experience in the 
food industry, having held 
critical commercial roles 
in sales, marketing and 
general management, 
including President and 
CEO.
Under this revitalised 
US leadership team, 
the company has 
become more market-
driven, innovative and 
aligned with consumer 
preferences, supported by 
a strong operations team.
As part of continuing 
efforts to improve 
operational excellence and 
profitability, we divested 
the non-performing Sager 
Creek vegetable business 
in September 2017, closed 
its factory, and also shut 
another plant in Indiana. 
As a result of these, we 
booked one-off expenses 
amounting to US$62.7 
million in FY2018. These 
planned closures will 
lead to improvement in 
margins starting FY2019 
as well as generate 
stronger cash flow 
through lower inventories. 
We continue to review 
our manufacturing and 
distribution footprint in 
the US.
We also continued to 
strengthen our core 
business in Asia. Both 
the Philippines and S&W 
markets delivered record 
sales in FY2018.
INNOVATING 
PRODUCTS AND 
PROCESSES
The Group has been 
working on making 
product innovation more 
broad-based, and focusing 
on real innovation, not 
just mere renovation or 
product line extension. 
Further to the successful 
innovation in packaged 
fruit and broth in the 
US, we are working on 
vegetable and tomato 
innovation, especially 
in packaging and more 
value-added products 
for the consumer, going 
beyond traditional, 
commoditised offerings.
Under new leadership, 
DMFI increased focus 
on innovation in the 
USA, significantly shifting 
project focus from base 
work to new product 
development.
We entered into a new 
category of frozen 
pineapple using Nice 
Fruit’s breakthrough 
technology which allows 
fruits and vegetables 
to be frozen for up to 
three years and, once 
thawed, still retain their 
original properties just 
like fresh. This award-
winning technology is a 
game-changer for both 
our foodservice and retail 
markets. We have started 
selling in Japan with 
excellent feedback, and 
have sent the product 
to the US, Europe, 
Middle East and other 
parts of Asia for market 
development.
Across our businesses 
and markets, we need to 
decommoditise the low-
priced segment of our 
product portfolio, whether 
it’s canned products 
in the US for retail and 
foodservice, or pineapple 
juice concentrate (PJC). 
While we have reduced 
our PJC sales over time 
and shifted capacity 
to branded retail and 
foodservice juices, we 
have not yet completely 
eliminated our exposure to 
this commodity.
Our innovation in the 
Philippines will go beyond 
focusing on beverage, 
and will include more new 
product launches in fruits 
and culinary, focusing 
on value-added and 
differentiated offerings.
Innovation goes beyond 
launching new products, 
includes our processes 
and cuts across all 
functions of our Company.
1. Agriculture: We have 
been transforming 
our plantation in 
the Philippines by 
allocating more land 
and resources to 
growing more premium 
MD2 or Sweet 16 fresh 
pineapple to support 
the growth of our 
S&W business. We will 
continue to leverage 
precision agriculture 
and technology, such 
as drone technology, 
to improve our 
productivity.
2. Production and Supply 
Chain: Since FY2015, 
we have closed four 
plants in the US. We 
continue to review our 
manufacturing and 
distribution footprint 
in the US to improve 
operational effi  ciency. 
We will leverage co-
packing opportunities 
and outsource product 
innovation to improve 
our agility and speed to 
launch new products. 
We will be more 
market-driven and not 
supply-driven.
3. Marketing: We will 
market as a brand 
leader and build brand 
equity, and not just rely 
on trade promotion, 
especially in the US. In 
fact, we are rationalising 
trade promotion that 
does not yield positive 
returns, and are driving 
spending effi  ciency. We 
are also entering the 
frozen food sector with 
a patented and award-
winning process from 
Nice Fruit of Spain. This 
process gives frozen 
fruits and vegetables 
a shelf life of three 
years and retains the 
characteristics of fresh 
when thawed.
4. Sales: We will no longer 
focus solely on retail 
centre-of-store, but 
also on retail perimeter, 
convenience stores 
and foodservice. If 
we do not disrupt our 
traditional route to 
market, somebody else 
will.
5. Digital: We will continue 
to execute a strategy 
where we partner with 
e-commerce providers 
in order to sell more 
products online. 
Consumers have been 
changing the way they 
shop. Accordingly, we 
will increase the share 
of digital marketing. 
Millennials are spending 
more time online versus 
traditional media.
6. Support functions: 
We will continue to 
outsource back-offi  ce 
and support functions 
beyond accounting and 
IT to a cost-competitive 
global service provider. 
We have reinforced our 
cyber security systems. 
We will optimise 
G&A costs across our 
businesses.

LETTER TO
SHAREHOLDERS
7. Renewable energy: We 
will leverage alternative, 
renewable sources 
of energy, amidst 
rising energy costs. 
Our waste-to-energy 
facility in the Philippines 
reduced electricity 
cost by over 20%, 
reducing dependence 
on more expensive, less 
sustainable sources of 
energy. 
These are examples of 
how we innovate our 
businesses and processes. 
We aspire to achieve 
better results and cannot 
do more of the same. We 
need to cultivate a mindset 
that is constantly seeking 
more effi  cient and more 
effective ways of achieving 
better results.
FY2018 RESULTS
Our Group generated 
sales of US$2.2 billion 
in FY2018, down 2.5% 
from prior year on higher 
Philippines and S&W Asia 
sales, offset by lower US 
and Europe sales.
Sales in the USA were 
down by 2.5% largely due 
to lower canned tomato 
sales, and unfavourable 
pricing in foodservice 
and US Department 
of Agriculture (USDA). 
We are deprioritising 
low-margin, non-core 
businesses of USDA and 
private label, and focusing 
on more value-added, 
less commoditised 
products both in retail and 
foodservice.
Our Philippine business 
delivered record sales of 
US$333.8 million, up 7% in 
peso terms as all product 
categories – packaged 
fruit, beverage and culinary 
– posted higher sales, 
while the fastest-growing 
foodservice channel 
continued to expand. 
Sales of the S&W business 
in Asia and the Middle East 
reached a record US$106.1 
million, 6% higher due 
to strong double-digit 
growth of the S&W Sweet 
16 fresh pineapple, mainly 
in North Asia.
Sales at our Indian joint 
venture (JV) FieldFresh 
Foods, which are equity 
accounted, were US$76.2 
million in FY2018 driven 
by the 10% growth of 
the Del Monte business. 
FieldFresh sustained its 
positive EBITDA while our 
Company’s share of loss 
in the JV was much lower 
at only US$0.3 million, 
nearing breakeven.
Without one-off items, the 
Group generated EBITDA 
of US$165.0 million, down 
22%, and net profit of 
US$12.0 million, down 
74%. Profitability was 
impacted by unfavourable 
USDA and foodservice 
pricing in the USA, 
unfavourable sales mix 
and significantly lower 
industrial PJC pricing in 
the international market. 
The Group has been 
shifting to more branded 
consumer beverage given 
the volatile nature of 
industrial and commodity 
PJC.
Including one-off items, 
the Group generated 
EBITDA of US$102.3 
million, down 47%, and 
a net loss of US$36.5 
million. One-off expenses 
were incurred in the USA 
due to the planned closure 
of factories to streamline 
operations and become 
cost competitive, and 
write-off of deferred tax 
assets due to the change 
in the US Federal income 
tax rate.
STRATEGY
Del Monte is an iconic 
brand, a household name 
in the United States with 
over 130 years of brand 
heritage. However, as 
with most canned food 
products, we are faced 
with structural declines 
in the industry. Our 
strategy must recognise 
the fundamental changes 
in the marketplace 
and technology for 
consumer goods. 
There are disruptions 
everywhere - in the 
centre store, distribution 
channels, supply 
chains, technological 
developments, consumer 
demographics and 
behaviour.
There has been a 
fundamental shift in how 
people purchase, prepare 
and enjoy their food, and 
the pace of change will 
only intensify. Success will 
require great execution 
against growth strategy 
areas.
We must think “outside 
the can”. We have been 
introducing on-trend 
products in growing 
formats such as cups and 
cartons. We will intensify 
this with a medium-term 
target of 20% of US sales 
coming from innovation 
from only 1% in FY2018.
We will further develop 
new categories of frozen 
and snacking. We will 
increase the share of 
value-added products 
in both retail and 
foodservice. 
With the Fresh Del 
Monte joint ventures 
on chilled fruit snacks, 
juices, guacamole and 
avocado products, and 
retail F&B, we formed the 
“Perimeter & Convenience 
team” in the US to unlock 
growth opportunities in 
the perimeter of store 
and the rapidly growing 
convenience store 
channel.
FY2018 was a year of 
transition for our US 
business marked by new 
leadership, and an updated 
long-range plan designed 
to build its brands, 
bring differentiated and 
innovative products to 
market, expand channels 
of distribution and 
optimise supply chain.
Our business is well 
positioned vis-à-vis 
the ongoing consumer 
trends for health, wellness 
and nutrition. There is 
latent market demand 
to consume more fruits 
and vegetables. We must 
recognise and seize

LETTER TO
SHAREHOLDERS
7. Renewable energy: We 
will leverage alternative, 
renewable sources 
of energy, amidst 
rising energy costs. 
Our waste-to-energy 
facility in the Philippines 
reduced electricity 
cost by over 20%, 
reducing dependence 
on more expensive, less 
sustainable sources of 
energy. 
These are examples of 
how we innovate our 
businesses and processes. 
We aspire to achieve 
better results and cannot 
do more of the same. We 
need to cultivate a mindset 
that is constantly seeking 
more effi  cient and more 
effective ways of achieving 
better results.
FY2018 RESULTS
Our Group generated 
sales of US$2.2 billion 
in FY2018, down 2.5% 
from prior year on higher 
Philippines and S&W Asia 
sales, offset by lower US 
and Europe sales.
Sales in the USA were 
down by 2.5% largely due 
to lower canned tomato 
sales, and unfavourable 
pricing in foodservice 
and US Department 
of Agriculture (USDA). 
We are deprioritising 
low-margin, non-core 
businesses of USDA and 
private label, and focusing 
on more value-added, 
less commoditised 
products both in retail and 
foodservice.
Our Philippine business

to 20% of total Philippine

expanding by a robust 15%

INNOVATION
DMPI’s innovation 
strategy has always been 
consistent with its mission 
of bringing to life health 
and wellness. Its most 
successful innovations 
have always been 
anchored on an in-depth 
understanding of unmet 
consumer needs, and 
sometimes, unarticulated 
consumer wants.
The aggressive growth of 
its beverage line in recent 
years, for example, has 
been anchored on new 
news. By pivoting from just 
pure, natural refreshment 
into a consumer-relevant 
functional benefit 
platform, and highlighting 
immunity, detoxification, 
cholesterol management, 
bone strength, weight 
management and 
rehydration across its 
different beverage product 
lines, Del Monte has been 
able to build affi  nity and 
relevance across a broader 
base of consumers and 
across an expanded 
range of consumption 
occasions. 
Packaging format 
innovation has also been 
central to DMPI’s success. 
Its pioneering launch 
of the Stand-Up Pouch 
(SUP) formats in both 
the culinary and fruits 
category not only 
transformed the industry 
traditionally dependent 
on expensive and bulky 
can formats. Its significant 
head start versus 
competition also allowed 
the brand to win big 
behind more competitive 
pricing, improved 
dominant on-shelf impact 
in the modern trade, and 
expanded distribution in 
the secondary and tertiary 
trade channels.
In more recent periods, its 
launch of the 1-litre carton 
format for beverages 
reignited consumer 
interest and generated 
resurgent growth for 
the multi-serve segment 
which has been previously 
decelerating due to 
inconvenient and bulky 
can formats. 
AWARDS AND 
RECOGNITION
The Philippine Market 
team has been awarded 
and recognised multiple 
times, attesting to its 
standards of excellence, 
including the following 
recognition: 7-Eleven 
Philippines’ Best Supplier 
of the Year Award, Most 
Innovative Supplier 
and Best in Account 
Management; Robinsons’ 
Gold Apple Award (Food 
Division); and Tomato 
Sauce’s “Come Home” 
Campaign Tambuli Award. 
Del Monte Kitchenomics 
has won numerous awards 
over the years, including 
Spark Awards for Media 
Excellence: Gold for 
Best App, Gold for Best 
Use of Branded Content, 
and Silver for Best Media 
Solution.
PHILIPPINE JOURNEY
Philippine sales expanded 
in the past three years to 
P16.9 billion in FY2018 at 
a compounded annual 
growth of 8.1%, driven by 
the 12.4% CAGR of the 
foodservice channel and 
9.2% CAGR of the culinary 
category. During this 
period, operating income 
grew to P3.3 billion at a 
CAGR of 10%.
The Philippine market 
drives the growth of 
DMPI, the second largest 
and most profitable 
subsidiary of Del Monte 
Pacific Ltd. Del Monte has 
grown with the Philippine 
economy with the trust 
and loyalty of millions of 
Filipino consumers. As the 
economy continues to 
grow, and the Philippine 
market innovates with 
new healthy products, 
and expands into new 
channels and market 
segments, the company 
is well positioned to grow 
further. The Philippine 
market is expected to 
continue to deliver higher 
revenue and profits with 
its household Del Monte 
brand.

SALES
DMPL generated sales of 
US$2.2 billion in FY2018, 
lower by 2.5% versus the 
prior year as higher sales 
in the Philippines and S&W 
in Asia and the Middle 
East were offset by lower 
sales in the United States 
and Europe (on lower 
volume of the cyclical 
commodity pineapple 
juice concentrate 
(PJC) and significantly 
lower pricing due to 
oversupply situation in the 
international market). 
USA
DMPL’s US subsidiary, Del 
Monte Foods, Inc (DMFI), 
generated sales of US$1.7 
billion or 75.3% of Group 
sales, lower by 2.5% versus 
prior year largely due to 
lower canned tomato 
sales, and unfavourable 
pricing in foodservice 
and US Department of 
Agriculture (USDA). The 
key retail segments of 
canned vegetable, canned 
fruit, broth and plastic fruit 
cup snacks all grew sales 
for the full year despite 
some category declines in 
the canned segment. 
Del Monte Foods 
increasingly offers 
differentiated value 
propositions through 
meaningful product 
improvements, 
marketing campaigns, 
and innovation as well 
as effectively managing 
pricing fundamentals and 
executing well at the retail 
channel. 
Two years ago, to meet 
the unique snacking needs 
of on-the-go adults, DMFI 
introduced Del Monte® 
Fruit Refreshers®, the 
first-ever adult fruit cup, 
bringing unexpected 
fruit flavours and exciting 
combinations in refreshing 
fruit waters. Del Monte® 
Fruit Refreshers® won 
the 2017 Product of the 
Year Award in the Healthy 
Snacking category in 
the USA. Last year, DMFI 
expanded the adult fruit 
cup snacking segment 
with the launch of Del 
Monte® Fruit & Chia™, 
a category first which 
combines luscious chunks 
of fruit with wholesome 
chia. This product 
exceeded the company’s 
distribution and velocity 
targets. 
Shortly thereafter, to 
unlock the on-the-go 
usage occasion, DMFI 
introduced the grab-
and-go fruit cup snacks 
which are single-serve 
portable cups with ‘sporks’ 
in the lid, for convenient 
snacking on the go. It 
comes in four amazing 
flavours: Grapefruit & 
Orange in Pomegranate 
Water, Mandarin Orange in 
Coconut Water, Peaches 
in Strawberry Dragon 
Fruit Chia and Pears in 
Blackberry Chia.
These new products 
were launched to 
address consumer 
trends of healthy 
living, snacking and 
convenience. Nearly 50% 
of US food consumption 
is in snacking, hence, the 
exciting potential in this 
fruit cup segment.

digit growth of the S&W 
Sweet 16 fresh pineapple 
mainly in China and the 
Middle East. However, 
the packaged segment’s 
sales were lower due 
to unfavourable sales 
mix, and lower sales 
of packaged pineapple 
products in North Asia 
due to cheaper-priced 
competition from Thailand 
and Indonesia. These 
were partly offset by new 
product launches in new 
packaging formats in 
North Asia and the Middle 
East, and expansion into 
Turkey.
The fresh segment 
accounted for 72% 
of S&W’s total sales 
in FY2018, while the 
packaged segment 
accounted for the balance 
28%.
S&W’s key initiatives in 
FY2018:
• New product launches:
- S&W Fruit & Chia 
cups in 3 variants

slices and chunks 
in China and Korea. 
Clear Cans are 
see-through plastic 
containers with 
metal lids, which 
allow consumers

was lower than last year 
and its gross margin 
decreased to 30.4% from 
32.5% due to unfavourable 
sales mix, significantly 
lower PJC pricing in the 
international market, and 
the unfavourable impact 
from revaluation of 
biological assets. 
EBITDA AND NET PROFIT
DMPL’s EBITDA of 
US$102.3 million was 
lower by 47.3%. Half of the 
decline was attributed to 
the reasons mentioned 
above that impacted 
gross profit while half was 
due to one-off expenses 
amounting to US$29.1 
million after deducting the 
one-off gain. 
As part of the Group’s 
strategy to improve 
operational excellence and 
profitability, DMFI divested 
its underperforming Sager 
Creek vegetable business 
in the second quarter of 
FY2018. This involved 
shutting the production 
facility in Siloam Springs, 
Arkansas. DMFI also shut 
its Plymouth, Indiana 
tomato production 
facility in the third quarter 
of FY2018 to improve 
effi  ciency and streamline 
operations. These resulted 
in one-off expenses of 
US$62.7 million pre-tax. 
The one-off expenses also 
included a writedown of 
Sager Creek’s inventory 
which the Group planned 
to dispose of in FY2019. 
DMFI recorded a loss 
of US$9.0 million at 
EBITDA level. DMFI 
successfully executed 
the consolidation of its 
Indiana plant that had just 
been closed into its other 
tomato facility in California 
to improve the overall 
utilisation of packaged 
tomato assets. 
Please refer to the table 
below for the schedule of 
one-off items.
Excluding one-off 
expenses, the Group’s 
EBITDA would have been 
US$165.0 million, 22.1% 
lower versus the recurring 
EBITDA of US$211.9 
million last year.

As part of its multiyear restructuring project to streamline operations and improve profitability, the Group closed three plants in the US in FY2017-2018. It also 
shifted to a leaner organisation model in the US to drive channel growth and bring down costs in line with competition, hence, the severance costs.

Please refer to the “Cash Flow and Debt” section in the next page for the purchase of loan in the USA.

The Group wrote off US$39.8m of deferred tax assets at DMFI due to the change in Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Other companies in the US with 
deferred tax assets have similar write-offs due to the reduction in income tax rates. However, this should be more than offset by the reduced tax rates in future 
years which will be substantial.
Excluding one-off items, Gross Profit, EBITDA and Net Profit were lower than prior year due to unfavourable sales mix and

OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
versus prior year period’s 
US$58.9 million mainly 
from unfavourable sales 
mix, reduced export sales 
and much lower PJC 
pricing, and unfavourable 
impact from revaluation of 
biological assets, amongst 
others. 
The DMPL Group 
generated a net loss 
of US$36.5 million for 
the full year of FY2018, 
unfavourable versus prior 
year’s net income of 
US$24.4 million mainly 
due to the one-off 
expenses of US$48.5 
million (post-tax basis). 
Excluding the one-off 
expenses, the Group’s 
net income would have 
been US$12.0 million, 
lower versus the recurring 
net income last year of 
US$45.5 million mainly 
due to higher marketing 
investment in the USA to 
reinvigorate the business 
there in line with the 
Group’s long-range plan, 
lower export sales and 
significantly reduced PJC 
pricing.
FY2018 was a year of 
transition for DMFI marked 
by new leadership, and 
a new long-range plan 
designed to build brands, 
bring differentiated and 
innovative products to 
market, optimise supply 
chain, and expand 
distribution channels. 
Several important 
initiatives were launched 
in FY2018 to improve 
the health of the Group’s 
business in the USA and 
reverse the past several 
years of profit erosion: 
• Reduced Trade Spend 
and Supply Chain Cost 
Reduction projects 
• Deprioritised Margin 
Dilutive Businesses: 
Private label and USDA 
reductions
• Accelerated Innovation: 
New products created 
for centre store and 
perimeter / frozen
• Reduced and Idled 
Excess Production: On 
path to match supply 
with demand
• Focus on Branded 
Share and Distribution 
Growth: Retail and 
Foodservice channels
INVENTORIES
DMPL’s inventories 
amounted to US$761.0 
million as at 30 April 2018, 
lower than the US$916.9 
million as at 30 April 2017 
mainly due to planned 
reduction and divestiture 
of Sager Creek. 
CAPEX
Capital expenditures 
(capex) were US$148.2 
million in FY2018, slightly 
higher than the US$145.0 
million in the prior year. 
DMFI accounted for 
US$37.3 million of Group 
capex in FY2018, lower 
than the US$44.6 million 
in FY2017 due to plant 
closures, while DMPL ex-
DMFI’s capex accounted 
for US$110.8 million, up 
from US$98.4 million in 
FY2017 due to higher 
spending on standing 
crops.
PREFERENCE SHARE 
OFFERING
In December 2017, the 
Company successfully 
completed the offering 
and listing of its second 
tranche of Preference 
Shares (Series A-2) 
in the Philippines 
generating US$100 
million in proceeds for a 
combined US$300 million 
approximately for 2017, 
including the US$200 
million (Series A-1) 
raised in April 2017. The 
Company used the net 
proceeds to substantially 
refinance a US$350 million 
BDO Unibank, Inc loan 
due in February 2019. 
The coupon rate for Series 
A-1 is 6.625% while for 
Series A-2 is 6.5% per

semi-annually.
The Preference Shares 
are redeemable by the

CASH FLOW AND DEBT
The Group’s cash flow 
from operations in FY2018 
was US$322.9 million, 
significantly higher versus 
prior year’s cash flow of 
US$187.1 million due to 
better working capital 
management, in particular 
the reduction in DMFI’s 
inventory. Improvement in 
cash flow from operations 
contributed to the Group’s 
debt reduction efforts. 
As mentioned above, the 
Company successfully 
completed the offering 
and listing of its second 
tranche of Preference 
Shares in the Philippines 
generating approximately 
US$100 million in 
proceeds. 
As of the Company’s fiscal 
year end April 2018, it 
has also completed the 
purchase from certain 
lenders US$124.9 million 
worth of principal amount

ANNUAL REPORT FY2018

(out of a total of US$260 
million) of DMFI’s Second 
Lien Term Loans, which 
have been trading at a 
discount in the secondary 
market. The Company 
purchased the notes at a 
30% discount to par value.
The Second Lien Term 
Loans are the highest-
interest bearing loans 
for DMFI with an interest 
rate of LIBOR plus 7.25% 
(currently 9.75% p.a.) and 
will mature in August 2021.
While the Second Lien 
Term Loans that have 
been acquired currently 
remain on DMFI’s balance 
sheet as an obligation, 
the intercompany 
holdings of the loans and 
related interest expense 
is eliminated upon 
consolidation of the DMPL 
Group, thereby resulting in 
a reduction of leverage for 
the Group. 
This loan purchase is in 
line with the Company’s 
plan to delever its balance 
sheet and improve 
the capital structure 
and profitability of the 
DMPL Group, through 
a reduction in effective 
interest expense of US$8-
10 million per annum 
and savings from the 
purchase price discount 
for the Second Lien Term 
Loans. The one-off gain of 
US$33.6 million pre-tax or 
US$25.3 million post-tax, 
booked in FY2018 was a 
result of principal savings 
given the 30% purchase 
discount.
The Group’s net debt (cash 
and bank balances less 
borrowings) amounted 
to US$1.4 billion as at 30 
April 2018, lower than the 
US$1.7 billion as at 30 April 
2017 due to payment of 
borrowings, including the 
partial extinguishment of 
DMFI’s Second Lien Term 
Loans. 
Out of the total net debt 
of US$1.4 billion, DMFI 
accounted for US$806.4 
million while DMPL 
ex-DMFI accounted for 
US$634.5 million.
The Group’s net debt to 
equity ratio decreased to 
237% from 290% in the 
prior year.

In October 2017 and April 
2018, respectively, the 
Company paid dividends 
to holders of the Series

BUSINESS 
OUTLOOK
Barring unforeseen circumstances, 
DMPL is expected to be profitable in 
FY2019.
The Group will focus on 
strengthening its core business, 
while addressing and capitalising 
on changing consumer trends. 
Innovation, through better product 
and packaging development, 
and improved agriculture and 
manufacturing technology, will 
continue to fuel growth initiatives. 
DMPL’s entry into the frozen 
pineapple segment through its joint 
venture with Nice Fruit will be further 
leveraged as the Group brings this 
leading Nice Frozen Dry technology 
and exciting product into new 
markets and applications for both 
retail and foodservice. Please refer 
to pages 36-37 for more information 
on Nice Fruit.
There will be more cross-selling 
across the different markets of the 
Group, bringing products from the 
USA to Asia and vice-versa, and 
more digital opportunities including 
e-commerce for its range of 
products.
It will remain vigilant in keeping 
costs down, amidst an inflationary 
environment and lower pineapple 
juice concentrate pricing, through 
supply chain synergies and G&A cost 
optimisation.
As part of the Group’s deleveraging 
plan, DMPL plans to sell 
approximately 20% of its stake in 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Del Monte 
Philippines, Inc (DMPI), through a 
public offering on the Philippine 
Stock Exchange. The IPO was 
deferred due to volatile market 
conditions. The Company will 
announce as and when it relaunches 
this, subject to better market 
conditions.
USA
The Group faces headwinds from 
the long-term structural decline 
in canned categories in which it 
competes due to shifts in consumer 
preferences, shifts in the way 
American consumers are eating 
and shopping, as well as shifts in 
consumer demographics. 
Its commercial strategy will continue 
to build on its Del Monte brand 
heritage and will realign its business 
with these consumer trends over 
time. Its plan focuses on business 
segments which are on-trend in 
which it will invest in marketing to 
strengthen its leadership positions, 
pursue innovation to address 
growing consumer needs for more 
convenient, healthy and flavourful 
solutions, as well as build its 
distribution base in the growing store 
perimeter and emerging channels. At 
the same time, it will rationalise non-
profitable businesses, in particular 
the low-margin, non-branded 
segment.
With the four new joint ventures 
with Fresh Del Monte Produce 
Inc, the Group has the potential 
to greatly extend the reach of the 
Del Monte brand to the growing 
store perimeter while allowing both 
companies to optimise economies 
of scale. Business plans are being 
executed for chilled prepared fruit 
snacks, while business plans are 
being finalised for chilled juices, 
guacamole and avocado products, 
and Del Monte retail food and 
beverage outlets.
Over time, the product portfolio in 
the USA will no longer just be mostly 
canned but will have increasingly 
meaningful contribution from non-
can formats such as cups, cartons 
and pouches. New categories 
of frozen and snacking will be 
further developed. It will no longer 
focus solely on retail centre-of-
store, but also on retail perimeter,

SPECIFIC RISK WE FACE
RISK MITIGATION
Supply Chain 
Optimisation
The Group’s success with planned 
new products relies on the capabilities 
of its supply chain. New platforms 
necessitate changes in the Group’s 
business model.
The use of co-manufacturers will 
hasten the speed at which the Group 
develops new products. Food safety 
and compliance with the Food Safety 
Modernization Act impact brands, 
customer relationship and profitability.
• Executed the sale of the Sager Creek business 
and the shutdown of the Arkansas plant and the 
Plymouth plant in FY2018
• Rationalise the Group’s manufacturing and 
distribution footprint
• Implement a robust transformation programme 
that instills ownership and accountability across 
the supply chain to deliver the plans
• Institute a robust co-manufacturer evaluation 
system for product and process qualification, 
monitor quality audit results and swiftly implement 
corrective actions
Financial 
Leverage and 
Capital Structure
The Group has long-term acquisition 
financing resulting in a leveraged 
balance sheet.
Risks would arise if there is a general 
economic or industry slowdown that 
may impact the Group’s performance, 
which subsequently may affect the 
Group’s ability to service its interest 
and principal obligations.
• The Group successfully completed the offering 
and listing of about US$300 million Preference 
Shares in the Philippines in April and December 
2017, with a coupon rate of 6.625% p.a. and 6.5% 
p.a., respectively
• Net proceeds were used to partly refinance the 
US$350 million loan which was extended until 
February 2019
• The remaining balance of US$54 million of 
Preference Shares is issuable within 2 years
• DMPL purchased US$125 million of Second Lien 
Term Loans (as of April 2018) at a 30% discount in 
the secondary market providing the Group with 
significant interest and principal savings 
• The Group also expects to meet its financial 
obligation by generating more cash flows through 
the following: 
− Improved cash flows in the US which 
accounts for approximately 75% of Group 
sales
− Expected cost savings from selling, general 
and administrative expense reduction 
initiatives, managing working capital, 
production levels, productivity enhancements 
and operational effi  ciencies
− Expected sales and profit growth in the Asian 
business with the continuous expansion of the 
S&W brand in Asia and the Middle East both 
in packaged and fresh products and growth 
of the Philippine business through its market 
leadership position
• The Group manages its interest rate risk by 
swapping variables with fixed interest rates
− The majority of the term acquisition loans in 
the USA have already been swapped to fixed 
rates in February 2014, which took effect 
beginning February 2016 until 2021
Working Capital 
Management
There is excess inventory due to 
challenges in demand planning, crop 
tonnage, sales forecast and order 
fulfillment.
• Improve demand planning and adjust production 
plan to manage inventories and reduce wastage 
and obsolescence
• Conduct better oversight and monitoring of 
inventories using warehouse management system
• Execute the Group’s strategic plans to improve 
cash flow and profitability by strengthening the 
core business and introducing new product 
innovations and streamline operations

Tax
In the Philippines, the government 
passed a new regulation, Tax Reform 
for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN), 
which applies a tax on beverages with 
added sugar, petroleum products and 
coal, among others, which impact the 
cost of operation. Sixty percent of the 
Group’s beverage products, namely 
100% fruit and vegetable juices, are 
not subject to this tax.
The Group may lose certain tax 
incentives should it fail to comply with 
the conditions for the tax incentive.
The Group may be exposed to 
additional losses from write-offs 
of deferred tax credits should the 
operations in the US continue to incur 
losses.
• Implement plans to reduce the impact of the 
sugar tax by spreading the price adjustment across 
categories in order to temper the beverage price 
adjustment and protect consumption and volume
• Optimise production of 100% juice which is 
exempt from the sugar tax and work on product 
reformulation to mitigate the impact
• Work on cost savings from sales, general and 
administrative expense reduction initiatives, 
management of working capital, production 
levels, productivity enhancements and operational 
effi  ciencies
• Implement measures to comply with conditions 
related to the tax incentive
• Proper execution of the Group’s strategic and 
annual operating plan to meet its projected 
income in the US
Operations
As an integrated producer of packaged 
and fresh fruit products for the 
world market, the Group’s earnings 
are inevitably subject to certain 
other risk factors, which include 
general economic and business 
conditions, change in business 
strategy or development plans, 
international business operations, 
production effi  ciencies, input costs 
and availability, disruption of logistics 
and transportation facilities, litigious 
counterparties, insurgent activities and 
changes in government regulations, 
including, but not limited to, 
environmental regulations.
• Develop and execute a long-term strategic plan 
and annual operating plan supported by a business 
continuity plan, risk management and a corporate 
sustainability programme
• Pursue productivity-enhancing and effi  ciency-
generating work practices and capital projects
• Continue to comply with new legislations 
on the environment, regulatory, taxation and 
labour that affect operations and proactively 
develop strategies to reduce the impact of these 
regulations
 • Manage security risks in its operating units in the 
Philippines by strengthening security measures 
and improve its stakeholder relations in the 
communities where it operates
Environmental 
Risks
Production output is subject to 
certain risk factors relating to weather 
conditions, catastrophes, crop yields, 
crop diseases, contract growers and 
service providers’ performance and 
leasehold arrangements.
There is no assurance that natural 
catastrophes or climate change will 
not materially disrupt the Group’s 
business operations in the future or 
that the Group is fully capable to deal 
with these situations with respect to 
all the damages and economic losses 
resulting from these risks.
Our business in the US operates and 
contractually grows food in the United 
States where water availability may 
be at risk due to drought and limited 
water supply, new regulations on fresh 
water use and grey water discharges 
and increasing cost. 
• The Group develops and executes a long-
term strategic plan and annual operating plan, 
supported by a contingency plan and risk 
management measures
• The Group also has in place disaster recovery 
plans and business continuity plans to mitigate 
these incidents and has implemented programmes 
and initiatives to mitigate the effects of climate 
change
• The Group has Good Agricultural Practices 
(G.A.P.) certifications and complies with proven 
agricultural practices
• To manage any impact from heavy rainfall and 
floods, plantings are done in various locations 
to minimise tonnage loss, and towing units have 
been augmented to ensure continuity of harvest 
during wet conditions
• The Group also works with insurance brokers to 
assess the risk exposure and secure adequate 
insurance coverage, if cost effective

NURTURING NATURE
The success of our business is 
intertwined with responsible 
stewardship of nature which is the 
source of our products and profits. 
As such, we continuously build on 
our agricultural knowledge and 
experience and communicate 
DMFI’s and DMPI’s Environmental 
Policy to our stakeholders as we 
support resource effi  cient processes 
to enhance our environmental 
footprint. 
DMFI’s and DMPI’s Environmental 
Policy is updated periodically to 
reflect new advances in best practice 
and to better serve the Group’s 
operating needs. This policy is 
posted in facilities, communicated 
to facility management and also 
incorporated in the training for 
environmental and operations staff. 
DMFI is also an active participant 
in the Stewardship Index for 
Specialty Crops, a multi-stakeholder 
organisation piloting on-farm 
metrics with growers to track and 
monitor agricultural inputs to drive 
continuous improvement and gained 
effi  ciencies.
Our crops are locally sourced and 
travel less than an average of 160 
kilometres from the field to the 
manufacturing gate and an average 
of 560 kilometres from distribution 
centre to retailer.
DMFI is unique compared to our 
competitors because we have our 
own dedicated agricultural Seed 
Operations Research Team. The 
team provides growers with majority 
of our seeds for certain crops, 
including the Blue Lake, Romano 
and wax beans and other crops such 
as peas, corn and spinach. We are 
able to generate a higher yield for 
our corn and green beans. 
In the Philippines, the foundation 
of DMPI’s sustainable agriculture 
practices is effi  cient land use. 
Ecologically-minded land use 
management was carried on from 
our pioneers who started farming in 
1926. These pioneers did not clear 
forests to give way to pineapple 
fields. Additional land acquired 
later by our pioneers was already 
cultivated for other crops.
Across over 90 years of operations, 
our land use practices are mainly 
aimed at improving plantation 
yield through ecologically friendly 
land preparation, plant disease 
management and chemical 
application, effi  cient water sourcing 
and drainage and use of sustainable 
planting materials.

GOVERNANCE
Principle 14 
Shareholder Rights
The Group treats all shareholders fairly and equitably, and recognises, protects and facilitates the exercise of 
shareholders’ rights. Moreover, the Group continually reviews and updates such governance arrangements.
Shareholders are informed of changes in the Company’s business that are likely to materially affect the value of the 
Company’s shares. 
The Group ensures that shareholders have the opportunity to participate effectively in, and vote at GMs. Shareholders 
are informed of the rules and voting procedures that govern AGMs and GMs. The results of the votes taken during the 
AGM or GM are disclosed and made available to the public on the same day, and likewise uploaded on the Company’s 
website within five days from the date of the meeting. 
The Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association do not allow corporations which provide nominee or 
custodial services to appoint more than two proxies to vote. At present, only the Central Depository (Pte) Ltd is 
permitted to appoint more than two proxies. The Company does, however, allow non-shareholders to attend the 
AGM or GM as observers.
The Company’s dividend payment policy for Ordinary Shares has been to distribute a minimum of 33% of full year 
profit. For FY2018, the Company did not declare dividends to Ordinary shareholders due to its net loss position. 
The dividend policy and terms, including the declaration dates from previous years, are provided in the Company’s 
website. The Company endeavours to pay dividends within 30 days after declaration date.
Principle 15 
Communication with Shareholders/Investor Relations
The Group is committed to engaging its stakeholders and providing easy and regular access to timely, effective, 
fair, pertinent and accurate information about the Company. The Group has an Investor Relations policy that clearly 
articulates and promotes this.
The Company’s Investor Relations is handled in-house. It has a dedicated Investor Relations team comprising the 
Chief Corporate Officer and Investor Relations Manager who regularly engage and communicate with the investing 
community. Various IR and communication modes are employed by the Company to provide information and also 
to gather feedback and address questions and concerns. Insights and feedback gathered are taken and, where 
appropriate, acted upon.
The Company strengthens its relationship with the investing community and solicits their views through one-on-one 
meetings, participation in at least two annual conferences, forums and road shows organised by stock broking and 
investing companies. Between May 2017 and April 2018, the Company met with 84 investors, brokers and lenders, 
including conference calls, and did a roadshow for the second tranche of the Company’s Preference Shares offering. 
To maintain an open channel of communication, the Company also has an email alert system whereby emails on its 
developments and updates are sent out to investors. Such information is also announced to the public via the SGX-ST 
and PSE portals.
The Company has organised visits to its plantation and cannery, as well as trade checks, for the investing community, 
providing them with a first-hand appreciation and understanding of the Group’s operations and markets. 
The Company provides descriptive and detailed disclosures whenever possible and avoids boilerplate disclosures, and 
immediately announces any material information on the Company or any of its subsidiaries or associated companies.

INDEPENDENT  
AUDITORS’ REPORT
to the members of Del Monte Pacific Limited
Key Audit Matters (Cont’d)
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the matter
Fair value of biological assets 
The gain on changes in the fair value of produce prior 
to harvest and harvested produce amounted to US$45.1 
million for the year ended 30 April 2018.
The valuation of biological assets was significant to our 
audit because the estimation process is complex, involves 
significant management estimate, and is based on 
assumptions that can be affected by natural phenomena. 
The key assumptions for the fair value of harvested 
produce include selling prices and gross margins. The key 
assumptions for the fair value of produce prior to harvest 
include future selling prices, gross margin, estimated 
tonnage of harvests and future growing costs.
Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements.
We obtained an understanding of management’s fair value 
measurement methodology and their process in valuing 
the biological assets. We tested the key assumptions 
used in the valuation, which include selling prices and 
gross margin for harvested produce; and future selling 
prices, gross margin, estimated tonnage of harvests and 
future growing costs for produce prior to harvest, by 
comparing them to external data such as selling prices in 
the principal market and historical information. We also 
assessed the methodology used in estimating the fair 
value. 
 
We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures 
on the assumptions underlying the measurement of 
these biological assets.
Recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life trademarks
As at 30 April 2018, goodwill is carried at US$203.4 
million, which represents 14% of the total non-current 
assets. Indefinite life trademarks were carried at US$408.0 
million, which represents 27% of the total non-current 
assets.
(a) Goodwill and indefinite life trademarks allocated to 
Del Monte Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries
The Group’s goodwill is allocated to a Cash Generating 
Unit (CGU), Del Monte Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
Included within the CGU are the indefinite life trademarks 
“Del Monte” and “College Inn” in the United States of 
America (USA) amounting to US$394.0 million. The 
Group uses the value in use calculation to estimate the 
recoverable value of the CGU. 
The annual impairment test is significant to our audit 
because the valuation process is complex, involves 
significant management judgement, and is based on 
certain key assumptions, such as cash flow projections 
covering a five-year period and the long-term growth 
rate and discount rate of the CGU.
Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements.
We obtained an understanding of the Group’s impairment 
assessment process and the related controls. We tested 
the reasonableness of the key assumptions, which include 
revenue growth, gross margin and EBITDA margin, 
discount rate, long-term growth rate by comparing 
them to available market and historical information and 
management plans. 
Given the complexity of the valuation process, our 
internal valuation specialist was involved in performing 
some of these procedures. 
We also focused on the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in Note 8 to the financial statements, 
about those assumptions to which the outcome of the 
impairment test was most sensitive, that is, those that 
have the most significant effect on the determination of 
the recoverable amount of the CGU.

(b) Other indefinite life trademarks
As at 30 April 2018, other indefinite life trademarks 
were carried at US$14.0 million which comprises of the 
following trademarks: “Del Monte” in the Philippines 
and India, “S&W” in Asia, and “Todays” in the Philippines. 
The annual impairment tests are significant to our audit 
because the valuation process is complex, involves 
significant management judgment and estimates based 
on assumptions that can be affected by future market 
and economic conditions as well as trademark and 
royalty rates in the market.
The Group used the Royalty Savings Approach in valuing 
its Philippines and Asia S&W trademarks. This approach 
relies on the forecasted revenue for the related brand or 
trademark and applies the royalty rates in the market. For 
the India trademark, the Group used the discounted cash 
flow of the related CGU. This method relies on forecasted 
financial results which uses significant assumptions such 
as revenue growth rates, EBITDA and long-term margins, 
terminal value growth rate and discount rate. 
Refer to Notes 7 and 8 to the financial statements.
We assessed the reasonableness of the forecasted 
revenue and royalty rates used to derive the recoverable 
value of the brand and trademarks by comparing against 
available market and historical information. 
We also evaluated the significant assumptions used in 
the financial forecast of the CGU, which include revenue 
growth rates, EBITDA and long-term margins, terminal 
value growth rate and discount rate, by comparing them 
against available market information, historical data and 
management plans.
Given the complexity of the valuation process, our 
internal specialist was involved in performing some of 
these procedures. 
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
As at 30 April 2018, the Group has recognized net deferred 
tax assets of US$79.8 million, which includes deferred tax 
assets recognized by Del Monte Foods, Inc., a subsidiary 
in the United States of America (USA), amounting to 
US$77.8 million. 
The recoverability of the deferred tax asset was significant 
to our audit because it involves significant management 
judgment and is based on assumptions that are affected 
by future market or economic conditions. The key 
assumptions in the taxable income forecast include 
revenue growth rates and gross and EBITDA margins.
Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements.
We assessed the recognition of deferred tax assets by 
comparing it to the taxable income forecast. We tested 
the key assumptions in the taxable income forecast such 
as revenue growth rates and gross and EBITDA margins 
against available market information, management plans, 
historical performance and industry/market outlook. We 
compared the consistency of management's taxable 
income forecasts with those included in the budget 
approved by the Board of Directors.
We assessed the robustness of management’s forecasting 
process by comparing the actual results of the subsidiary 
against the forecast used in prior year.  
We involved our internal specialist in reviewing the 
temporary differences.

Valuation of defined benefit liability and asset
The Group has defined benefit plans in the Philippines and 
the USA, giving rise to defined benefit liability of US$65.1 
million and pension asset amounting to US$10.6 million 
as at 30 April 2018 which are measured using projected 
unit credit valuation methods.
We considered this to be a key audit matter because of 
the magnitude of the amounts, management's judgement 
in the use of assumptions such as future salary increases, 
discount rates, mortality rates and health care trends and 
technical expertise required to determine these amounts.
Refer to Note 21 to the financial statements.
Our procedures included, among others, involving our 
internal specialist to assist us in reviewing the valuation 
methodology and the actuarial and demographic 
assumptions used by management to value the 
Group's various pension obligations. We evaluated the 
competence, capabilities and objectivity of management’s 
specialist. 
We evaluated the key actuarial assumptions such as 
future salary increases, discount rates, mortality rates and 
health care trends by comparing them to market data 
and historical information. 
We tested the employees’ payroll data on a sample basis, 
and reviewed the reconciliation of the membership

AUDITORS’ REPORT

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control.
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group and Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
• 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT’D)
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in 
the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

Foreign currency (cont’d)
(ii) 
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on acquisition, are translated to US Dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and 
expenses of foreign operations are translated to US Dollars using monthly average exchange rates.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the 
foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) in equity. However, if the operation is a 
non-wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is 
allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, or 
joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation 
is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the group disposes of only 
part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant 
proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group 
disposes of only part of its investment in joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining 
significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to 
the income statement.
When the settlement of a monetary item that is a receivable from or payable to a foreign operation 
is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from 
such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are 
recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity.
4.3  
Current versus noncurrent classification 
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current and noncurrent 
classification. An asset is current when:
• 
It is expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle
• 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
• 
It is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period, or
• 
It is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least 12 months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as noncurrent. 
A liability is current when:
• 
It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle
• 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
• 
It is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period, or
• 
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
reporting period.
The Group classifies all other liabilities as noncurrent.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.

Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of raw materials, packaging materials, traded goods, cost of production materials and storeroom 
items is based on the FIFO (First-in First-out) method. Cost of processed inventories comprises all costs of 
purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition.
The costs of conversion include costs directly related to the units of production, and a systematic allocation of 
fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods.
The allocation of fixed production overheads is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. 
Normal capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average for the periods or seasons under 
normal circumstances, taking into account the seasonal business cycle of the Group.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs 
of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of growing crops transferred from biological assets is its fair value less cost to sell at the date of 
harvest.
4.10 
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amount of 
cash with original maturities of three months or less that are subject to insignificant risk of change in value.
4.11 
Impairment
(i) 
Non-derivative financial assets 
A financial asset not classified at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective 
evidence indicates that a loss event(s) have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that 
the loss event(s) had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be 
estimated reliably.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired can include default or delinquency by a debtor, 
restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise, 
indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of 
borrowers or issuers in the Group, or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Loans and receivables
The Group considers evidence of impairment for loans and receivables at both a specific asset and 
collective level. All individually significant loans and receivables are assessed for specific impairment. All 
individually significant receivables found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively assessed 
for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified. 
Loans and receivables that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by 
grouping together loans and receivables with similar risk characteristics.

Noncurrent assets held for sale
Noncurrent assets held for sale are classified as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale 
and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Once classified as held-for-sale, property, plant and equipment are no longer depreciated. If it is no longer 
highly probable that an asset will be recovered primarily through sale, the asset ceases to be classified as held-
for-sale and is measured at the lower of its carrying amount before the asset was classified as held-for-sale 
adjusted for any depreciation that would have been recognised had the asset not been reclassified as held for 
sale and its recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent reclassification. The required adjustment to the 
carrying amount of an asset that ceases to be classified as held-for-sale is included in the consolidated income 
statement. The Group classified certain assets in Plymouth, Indiana and Siloam Springs, Arkansas as held-for-
sale as of 30 April 2018 (see Note 16). The Group did not have any assets held for sale as of 30 April 2017. 
4.13 
Employee benefits
(i) 
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee 
benefit expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
(ii) 
Defined benefit pension plan
A defined benefit pension plan requires contributions to be made to separately administered funds. 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, 
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The Group determines the 
net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the 
discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to 
the net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability 
(asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic 
benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan 
in the Group. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, 
or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
Service costs which include current service costs, past service costs and gains or losses on non-routine 
settlements are recognised as expense in profit or loss.  Past service costs are recognised when plan 
amendment or curtailment occurs.

(ii) 
Defined benefit pension plan (cont’d)
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on 
plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group 
recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all expenses related to defined 
benefit plans in staffcost in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is 
curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the plan amendment or curtailment occurs, the Group recognises gains and losses on the 
settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on settlement is the 
difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on 
the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments 
made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement. In fiscal 2016, a plan amendment was 
implemented for certain medical and dental benefits (see Note 21). 
Multi-employer plans
The Group participates in several multi-employer pension plans, which provide defined benefits 
to certain union employees. The Group accounts for its proportionate share of the defined benefit 
obligation, plan assets and cost associated with the plan in the same way as other defined benefit plan. 
For certain union employee related retirement plans where sufficient information is not available to use 
defined benefit accounting, the Group accounts for these plans as if they were defined contribution 
plans.
(iii) 
Other plans
The Group has various other non-qualified retirement plans and supplemental retirement plans for 
executives, designed to provide benefits in excess of those otherwise permitted under the Group’s 
qualified retirement plans. These plans are unfunded and comply with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
rules for non-qualified plans.
(iv) 
Other long-term employee benefits
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior 
periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any related assets 
is deducted. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method. Any actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
(v) 
Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, 
without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment 
before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to 
encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits are recognised as an expense once the Group 
has announced the plan to affected employees.

Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as 
the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-
term cash bonus if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
(vii) 
Share-based payment transactions
The Group grants share awards and share options to employees of the Group. The fair value of incentives 
granted is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value is measured at grant date and accounted for as described below.
Share awards
The fair value, measured at grant date, is recognised over the period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
Share options
The fair value, measured at grant date, is recognised over the vesting period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the options. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates 
of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the 
revision of original estimates in employee benefit expense and as a corresponding adjustment to equity 
over the remaining vesting period.

Share capital and retained earnings
(i) 
Share capital
Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Holders of these shares are entitled to dividends as declared 
from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at general meetings of the Company. 
Preference shares
Preference shares are classified as equity. Holders of these shares are entitled to cash dividends based 
on the issue price, at the dividend rate per annum from the issue date, payable every 7 October and 7 
April of each year following the issue date, upon declaration by the BOD.
The transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary and preference shares are accounted 
for as deduction from equity to the extent they are incremental costs directly attributable to the 
equity transaction that otherwise would have been avoided. The costs of an equity transaction that is 
abandoned are recognised as an expense.

Repurchase, disposal and reissue of share capital (treasury shares)
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which 
includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. 
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the reserve for own shares. 
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an 
increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in share premium.
Share premium
Share premium represents the excess of consideration received over the par value of ordinary and 
preference shares net of transaction costs from issuance of share capital, share options exercised and 
released of share awards granted.

Retained Earnings
Retained earnings include profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group and reduced by dividends 
declared on share capital. 
(iii) 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from retained earnings when they are declared. 
4.15 
Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
(i) 
Environment remediation liabilities
In accordance with the Group’s environment policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for 
environmental remediation obligations and the related expense is recognised when such losses are 
probable and the amounts of such losses can be estimated reliably. Accruals for estimated losses for 
environmental remediation obligations are recognised no later than the completion of the remedial 
feasibility study. These accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change.
(ii) 
Retained insurance liabilities
The Group accrues for retained insurance risks associated with the deductible portion of any potential 
liabilities that might arise out of claims of employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury 
or property damage occurring in the course of the Group’s operations. 
A third-party actuary is engaged to assist the Group in estimating the ultimate cost of certain retained 
insurance risks. Additionally, the Group’s estimate of retained insurance liabilities is subject to change as 
new events or circumstances develop which might materially impact the ultimate cost to settle these 
losses.

the Group; or
(b) 
a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
(i) 
It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to

The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only

of the Group.
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the statement of financial position of the Group, except

New standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted
Pronouncements issued but not yet effective are listed below. Unless otherwise indicated, the Company and 
the Group do not expect that the future adoption of the said pronouncements will have a significant impact on 
its financial statements. The Company and the Group intends to adopt the following pronouncements when 
they become effective.
Applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2018
• 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014)
IFRS 9 (2014) replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and supersedes 
the previously published versions of IFRS 9 that introduced new classifications and measurement 
requirements (in 2009 and 2010) and a new hedge accounting model (in 2013). IFRS 9 includes revised 
guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets, including a new expected credit 
loss model for calculating impairment, guidance on own credit risk on financial liabilities measured 
at fair value and supplements the new general hedge accounting requirements published in 2013. 
IFRS 9 incorporates new hedge accounting requirements that represent a major overhaul of hedge 
accounting and introduces significant improvements by aligning the accounting more closely with risk 
management. The new standard is to be generally applied retrospectively for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018, subject to certain exemptions provided by the standard. The Company 
and the Group is still determining the optimal transition approach to adopting IFRS 9. The assessments 
made by the Company and Group below is preliminary and incomplete, and therefore may be subject 
to change.

IFRS 16 Leases supersedes IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations 
The new standard introduces a single lease accounting model for lessees under which all major leases 
are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position, removing the lease classification test. Lease 
accounting for lessors essentially remains unchanged except for a number of details including the 
application of the new lease definition, new sale-and-leaseback guidance, new sub-lease guidance and 
new disclosure requirements. Practical expedients and targeted reliefs were introduced including an 
optional lessee exemption for short-term leases (leases with a term of 12 months or less) and low-value 
items, as well as the permission of portfolio-level accounting instead of applying the requirements to 
individual leases. New estimates and judgemental thresholds that affect the identification, classification 
and measurement of lease transactions, as well as requirements to reassess certain key estimates and 
judgements at each reporting date were introduced.
Early application is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 at or before the date of initial application 
of IFRS 16. The Group is assessing the potential impact on its financial statements resulting from the 
application of IFRS 16.
• 
IFRIC-23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments clarifies how to apply the recognition and 
measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax 
treatments.
Under the interpretation, whether the amounts recorded in the financial statements will differ to that 
in the tax return, and whether the uncertainty is disclosed or reflected in the measurement, depends 
on whether it is probable that the tax authority will accept the entity’s chosen tax treatment. If it is not 
probable that the tax authority will accept the entity’s chosen tax treatment, the uncertainty is reflected 
using the measure that provides the better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty – either 
the most likely amount or the expected value. The interpretation also requires the reassessment of 
judgements and estimates applied if facts and circumstances change – e.g. as a result of examination 
or action by tax authorities, following changes in tax rules or when a tax authority’s right to challenge 
a treatment expires.
The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2019. Earlier application 
is permitted.
• 
Amendments to IAS 19 Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement 
The amendments clarify that on amendment, curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan, a 
company now uses updated actuarial assumptions to determine its current service cost and net interest 
for the period and the effect of the asset ceiling is disregarded when calculating the gain or loss on any 
settlement of the plan and is dealt with separately in other comprehensive income.
The amendments apply for plan amendments, curtailments or settlements that occur on or after the 
beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins on or after 1 May 2019. Earlier application is 
permitted.

• 
Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment features with negative compensation 
Under IFRS 9, a debt instrument can be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, provided that the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding’ (the SPPI criterion) and the instrument is held within the 
appropriate business model for that classification. The amendments to IFRS 9 clarify that a financial 
asset passes the SPPI criterion regardless of the event or circumstance that causes the early termination 
of the contract and irrespective of which party pays or receives reasonable compensation for the 
early termination of the contract. The basis for conclusions to the amendments clarified that the early 
termination can result from a contractual term or from an event outside the control of the parties to the 
contract, such as a change in law or regulation leading to the early termination of the contract.
• 
Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term interests in associate and joint ventures
The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 to long-term interests in an associate or joint 
venture to which the equity method is not applied but that, in substance, form part of the net investment 
in the associate or joint venture (long-term interests). This clarification is relevant because it implies that 
the expected credit loss model in IFRS 9 applies to such long-term interests.
The Board also clarified that, in applying IFRS 9, an entity does not take account of any losses of the 
associate or joint venture, or any impairment losses on the net investment, recognised as adjustments 
to the net investment in the associate or joint venture that arise from applying IAS 28.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2019. Earlier application 
is permitted.
Applicable for the first annual reporting period that begins on or after 1 May 2021
• 
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
The overall objective of IFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more 
useful and consistent for insurers.
In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local 
accounting policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all 
relevant accounting aspects. The core of IFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:
• 
A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach)
• 
A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts

Plant closures and divestiture of Sager Creek business (cont’d)
Northwest Arkansas Distribution and Warehouse Facilities 
The Group announced on 19 January 2018 its intention to close its distribution and warehouse facilities in 
Northwest Arkansas. These closures will take place during the first half of fiscal year 2019. 
Under the termination plan, approximately 125 employees were affected, the majority of which were terminated 
by the end of fiscal year 2018. The Group recognised provisions for employee severance benefits amounting 
to US$1.3 million, with US$1.1 million outstanding as of 30 April 2018. The employee severance benefits are 
presented under “Employee benefits”.
Sager Creek – Turkey, North Carolina
In April 2016, the Group announced its intention to close Sager Creek’s plant in Turkey, North Carolina. The 
Group closed the plant’s canning facilities during fiscal year 2016 and the remainder of the production lines 
were redeployed to other production locations as of 30 April 2017. In connection with the plant closure, the 
Group recognised impairment losses on related property, plant and equipment amounting to US$5.0 million 
in fiscal year 2016.
Under the termination plan, approximately 300 employees were affected, about two-thirds of which were 
terminated by the end of fiscal year 2016, and the remainder terminated in fiscal year 2017. The Group recognised 
provisions for employee severance benefits amounting to US$1.4 million, with US$1.2 million outstanding as of 
30 April 2016. The employee severance benefits are presented under “Employee benefits”. Related equipment 
removal costs amounting to US$2.3 million, together with other related costs, were recognised in fiscal year 
2016 and included under “Trade and other payables”. These expenditures were incurred in fiscal year 2017 and 
there are no outstanding provisions as of 30 April 2017.
As of 30 April 2017, the Group has sold the Turkey plant and recognised a gain of US$0.7 million.
Source of estimation uncertainty
The Group estimates the useful lives of its buildings, land improvements, leasehold improvements and 
machineries and equipment based on the period over which the assets are expected to be available for use. The 
estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed periodically and are updated if expectations 
differ from previous estimates due to physical wear and tear, technical or commercial obsolescence and legal 
or other limits on the use of the assets. 
In addition, the estimation of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment is based on collective assessment 
of industry practice, internal technical evaluation and experiences with similar assets. It is possible, however, 
that future financial performance could be materially affected by changes in estimates brought about by 
changes in factors mentioned above. The amount and timing of recorded expenses for any period would be 
affected by changes in these factors and circumstances. A reduction in the estimated useful lives of property, 
plant and equipment would increase recorded depreciation expense and decrease noncurrent assets. 
The depreciation of bearer plants require estimation of future yield which is affected by natural phenomena 
and weather patterns.
The valuation of freehold land is based on comparable transaction subject to adjustments. These adjustments 
require judgement.
The recoverable amount of the impaired assets was based on fair value less cost to sell, which is subject to 
estimation.

The Company regularly reassesses whether it controls an investee when facts and circumstances indicate that

that it exercised control on all its subsidiaries as it has all elements of control.
In fiscal year 2015, the Group deconsolidated its subsidiary, Del Monte Andina C.A., an entity which has 
operations in Venezuela. Venezuela has a hyperinflationary economy. The Venezuelan exchange control 
regulations have resulted in other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan Bolivar and 
US Dollar. This has restricted the Venezuelan entity’s ability to pay dividends and obligations denominated in US 
Dollars. The exchange regulations, combined with other recent Venezuelan regulations, have constrained the 
Venezuelan entity’s ability to maintain normal production. Due to the Group’s inability to effectively control the 
operations of the entity, the Group deconsolidated the subsidiary with effect from February 2015. The equity 
interest in this entity is determined to be the cost of investment of the entity at the date of deconsolidation. 
The investment is carried at cost less impairment losses. 
Source of estimation uncertainty
When the subsidiary has suffered recurring operating losses, a test is made to assess whether the interests in 
subsidiary has suffered any impairment by determining the recoverable amount. This determination requires 
significant judgement and estimation. An estimate is made of the future profitability, cash flow, financial health 
and near-term business outlook of the subsidiary, including factors such as market demand and performance. 
The recoverable amount will differ from these estimates as a result of differences between assumptions used 
and actual operations.

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES (CONT’D)
Source of estimation uncertainty
When the joint venture has suffered recurring operating losses, a test is made to assess whether the investment 
in joint venture has suffered any impairment by determining the recoverable amount. This determination 
requires significant judgement and estimation. An estimate is made of the future profitability, cash flow, 
financial health and near-term business outlook of the joint venture, including factors such as market demand

Since its acquisition, the Indian sub-continent trademark and the investment in FFPL were allocated to the 
Indian sub-continent cash-generating unit (“Indian sub-continent CGU”). The recoverable amount of Indian 
sub-continent CGU was estimated using the discounted cash flows based on five-year cash flow projections.
Key assumptions used in discounted cash flow projection calculations
Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, revenue growth rates, 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin and terminal value growth rate. 
The values assigned to the key assumptions represented management’s assessment of future trends in the 
industries and were based on both external and internal sources.

In fiscal year 2018, discount rate is a pre-tax measure estimated based on past experience, and industry average 
weighted-average cost of capital, which is based on a possible rate of debt leveraging of 15.7% (2017: 14.7%) 
at a market interest rate of 9.5% (2017: 9.7%).
Revenue growth rate is expressed as compound annual growth rates in the initial five years of the plan. In 
the first year of the business plan, revenue growth rate was projected at 18% (2017: 15%) based on the near-
term business plan and market demand. The annual revenue growth included in the cash flow projections for 
four years was projected at the growth rate based on the historical growth in volume and prices and industry 
growth.
A long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined based on management’s estimate of the long-
term compound annual growth rate in the Indian economy which management believed was consistent with 
the assumption that a market participant would make.
EBITDA margin has been a factor of the revenue forecast based on business plan and market demand coupled 
with the cost saving initiatives.

Goodwill and the indefinite life trademarks are assessed for impairment annually. The impairment assessment 
requires an estimation of the VIU and fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU to which the goodwill and 
indefinite life trademarks are allocated.
Estimating the VIU requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU 
and apply an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Actual 
cash flows will differ from these estimates as a result of differences between assumptions used and actual 
operations.
Estimating fair value less costs of disposal requires the Group to calculate market multiples, derived from 
market price data of comparable companies, to be applied to the Group’s financial measures. The estimated 
fair value would change depending on the assumptions used, such as the annual revenue growth rate, EBITDA 
margin, and adjusted market multiples.

Asia S&W trademark
The amortisable trademark pertains to “Label Development” trademark.
America trademarks
The amortisable trademarks relate to the exclusive right to use of the “S&W” trademark in the United States, 
Canada, Mexico and certain countries in Central and South America and “Contadina” trademark in the United 
States, Canada, Mexico South Africa and certain countries in Asia Pacific, Central America, Europe, Middle East 
and South America market.
Management has included these trademarks in the CGU impairment assessment and concluded that no 
impairment exists at the reporting date.
Sager Creek trademarks
The trademarks were acquired when the Group acquired the Sager Creek business in March 2015. Sager Creek’s 
well-known brands include Veg-All, Freshlike, Popeye, Princella and Allens’, among others. Management has 
included these trademarks in the CGU impairment assessment and the Group did not recognize any impairment 
for these trademarks as of 30 April 2017. The Sager Creek trademarks were included in the sale of certain assets 
of Sager Creek in September 2017 (see Note 5).
Customer relationships
Customer relationships relate to the network of customers where DMFI has established relationships with the 
customers, particularly in the United States market through contracts. The Sager Creek customer relationships

The Group estimates the useful lives of its amortisable trademarks and customer relationships based on the 
period over which the assets are expected to be available for use. The estimated useful lives of the trademarks 
and customer relationships are reviewed periodically and are updated if expectations differ from previous 
estimates due to legal or other limits on the use of the assets. A reduction in the estimated useful lives of 
amortisable trademarks and customer relationships would increase recorded amortisation expense and 
decrease noncurrent assets.

The total amount of potential income tax consequences that would arise from the payment of cash dividends 
by a subsidiary to the Company, on the total retained earnings as at 30 April 2018, is approximately US$14.4 
million (30 April 2017: US$8.5 million). 
In 2017, no provision has been made in respect of this potential income tax as it is the Company’s intention to 
reinvest these reserves and not to distribute them as dividends.
In 2018, the Group plans to declare stock dividends from the excess reserves. No provision has been made 
because stock dividends are exempt from tax.

The tax losses will expire in 2019 and 2020. The tax carry forwards will expire between 2024 and 2027. Deferred 
tax assets have not been recognised with respect to these items because it is not probable that future taxable 
profits will be available to utilise the benefits.
Sources of estimation uncertainty
As of 30 April 2018, deferred tax assets amounting to US$119.6 million (30 April 2017: US$138.3 million) have 
been recognised in respect of the tax loss carry forwards because management assessed that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which DMFI can utilise these benefits. Management expects 
profitable growth coming from revenue strategies and cost efficiencies in the future. To the extent that 
profitable growth does not materialise in the future periods, net deferred tax assets of DMFI of US$77.8 million 
may not be realised. The majority of the tax loss for 30 April 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely and tax 
loss carry forwards prior to 30 April 2018 may be utilised up to a 20 year period.

During fiscal year 2016, a change to the post-retirement benefits plan of certain non-union employees 
were made where current retiree medical and dental benefits were replaced for contributions to a health 
reimbursement arrangement (HRA) account. As a result of the plan amendment, the Group’s defined benefit 
obligation decreased by US$40.7 million. A corresponding reduction against past service cost was recognised 
as part of “General and administrative expenses” account in the 2016 income statement of the Group.

The BOD of DMFI reviews the level of funding required for the retirement fund. Such a review includes the 
asset-liability matching (ALM) strategy and investment risk management policy. DMFI’s ALM objective is to 
match maturities of the plan assets to the retirement benefit obligation as they fall due. The Group monitors 
how the duration and expected yield of the investments match the expected cash outflows arising from the 
retirement benefit obligation.
DMFI’s investment objectives are to ensure that the assets of its qualified defined benefit plan are invested to 
provide an optimal rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio, consistent with the assumption 
of a reasonable risk level, and to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plan’s benefit obligations 
as they become due. 
DMFI believes that a well-diversified investment portfolio, including both equity and fixed income components, 
will result in the highest attainable investment return with an acceptable level of overall risk. DMFI’s investment 
policies and procedures are designed to ensure that the plan’s investments are in compliance with the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

The BOD of DMFI approves the percentage of asset to be allocated for fixed income instruments and equities. 
The retirement plan has set maximum exposure limits for each type of permissible investments in marketable 
securities and deposit instruments. The BOD of DMFI may, from time to time, in the exercise of its reasonable 
discretion and taking into account existing investment opportunities, review and revise such allocation and 
limits.
Source of estimation uncertainty
Pension expense and pension assets/liabilities are determined using certain actuarial estimates and assumptions 
relating to the discount rate used in valuing the subsidiary’s defined benefit obligations and future experiences 
such as the rate of return on plan assets, future salary increases, retirement date or age, mortality, and turnover 
rate of covered employees. These estimates and assumptions directly influence the amount of the pension 
assets/liabilities and expense recognised in the financial statements.
Sensitivity analysis
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following 
table summarises how the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of reporting period would have 
increased (decreased) as a result of a change in the respective assumptions by the respective percentages 
below.

The above sensitivities are based on the average duration of the benefit obligation determined at the date of 
the last full actuarial valuation at 30 April 2018 and are applied to adjust the defined benefit obligation at the 
end of the report period for the assumptions concerned. Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full 
distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the 
assumption shown.

Accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation is computed in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. 
This quantity is the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed under the projected unit credit method to 
service rendered prior to a particular date. Prior to an employee’s full eligibility date, the accumulated post-
retirement benefit obligation as of a particular date for an employee is the portion of the expected post-retirement 
benefit obligation attributed to that employee’s service rendered to that date; on and after the full eligibility date, 
the accumulated and expected post-retirement benefit obligations for an employee are the same. 
Source of estimation uncertainty
Accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation is determined using certain actuarial estimates and assumptions 
relating to the annual rate(s) of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the post-
retirement benefit plans due to factors other than changes in the composition of the plan population by age 
and dependency status, for each year from the measurement date until the end of the period in which benefits 
are expected to be paid. These estimates and assumptions directly influence the amount of the pension assets/
liabilities and expense recognised in the financial statements.
Multi-employer plans
The Group participates in several multi-employer pension plans, which provide defined benefits to covered 
union employees. Contributions rates to the multi-employer plans are provided in the collective bargaining 
agreements for the covered union employees. The contribution rates are expressed in terms of specific amounts 
to be contributed based on hours worked by covered union employees. The Group made contributions of  
US$6.1 million and US$7.1 million during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The risks of participating in the multi-employer pension plans are as follows:
• 
assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by the Group may be used to provide benefits to 
employees of other participating employers;
• 
if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable 
to such withdrawing employer may be partially borne by the Group; and
• 
if the Group stops participating in some of its multi-employer pension plans, the Group may be required 
to pay those plans an amount based on its allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan, referred 
to as a withdrawal liability.

SEASONALITY OF OPERATIONS
The Group’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations as a result of increased demand during the end of 
year festive season. For Americas, products are sold heavily during the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons. As 
such, the Group’s sales are usually highest during the three months from August to October.
The Group operates 14 production facilities (30 April 2017 and 2016: 15 production facilities) in the U.S., Mexico, 
and Philippines. Fruit plants are located in California and Washington in the United States and Philippines, 
most of its vegetable plants are located in the U.S. Midwest and its tomato plants are located in California and 
Indiana. 
The U.S. Consumer Food Business has a seasonal production cycle that generally runs between the months of 
June and October. This seasonal production primarily relates to the majority of processed fruit, vegetable and 
tomato products, while some of its processed fruit and tomato products and its College Inn broth products 
are produced throughout the year. Additionally, the Consumer Food Business has contracts to co-pack certain 
processed fruit and vegetable products for other companies.

SHARE OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS
The Del Monte Pacific Executive Stock Option Plan 1999 (“ESOP 1999”) of the Company was approved and 
amended by its shareholders at general meetings held on 30 July 1999 and 21 February 2002 respectively. No 
further options could be granted pursuant to the ESOP 1999 as it had expired on 24 July 2009. The options 
granted by the Company prior to 24 July 2009 are valid for a period of ten years from the date of the grant of 
options.
The Company adopted a new plan, the Del Monte Pacific Executive Share Option Plan 2016 (“ESOP 2016”), 
which was approved by the shareholders at the general meeting held on 30 August 2016. The purpose of the 
ESOP 2016 is to provide an opportunity for Group executives to participate in the equity of the Company in 
order to motivate them to excel in their performance. The ESOP 2016 shall be valid for a period of ten years; 
however, it has yet to be implemented.
The Company also had two share plans, the Del Monte Pacific Restricted Share Plan (“Del Monte Pacific RSP”) 
and the Del Monte Pacific PSP Performance Share Plan (“Del Monte Pacific PSP”) (collectively the “Share Plans”), 
which were approved by the Company’s shareholders at the general meeting held on 26 April 2005. The Share 
Plans sought to increase the Company’s flexibility and effectiveness in its continuing efforts to reward, retain 
and motivate employees targeted at executives holding key positions. The Share Plans expired after ten years 
or on 25 April 2015. Any share awards granted prior to the expiration of the Share Plans would continue to be 
valid.
Other information regarding the Del Monte Pacific RSP are as follows:
(a) 
No minimum vesting periods are prescribed.
(b) 
The length of the vesting period(s) in respect of each award granted will be determined on a case-to-
case basis by the RSOC.
(c) 
Delivery of shares upon vesting of the share awards may be by way of an issue of new shares and/or the 
transfer of existing shares (by way of purchase of existing shares).
On 12 May 2009, six employees of related companies were granted an aggregate of 3,749,000 share awards at

Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations.
On 20 September 2017, the Company released all of its outstanding share awards to its Directors. There were 
no additional share options exercised during the fiscal year ended 30 April 2018.

The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted-average expected 
life of the share options), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available 
information.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants. Service conditions and non-market 
performance conditions are not taken into account in the measurement of the fair value of the services to be 
received at the grant date.

Apart from the information stated above, the Group and Company have no significant concentration of credit 
risk with any single counterparty or group counterparties.
Derivatives
The derivatives are entered into with banks and financial institutions which are regulated. 
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in the market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates 
relates primarily to the Group’s long-term and short-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The Group’s cash balances are placed with reputable global banks and financial institutions. The Group 
manages its interest rate risks by placing the cash balances with varying maturities and interest rate terms. This 
includes investing the Group’s temporary excess liquidity in short-term low-risk securities from time to time. 
The Group also enters into interest rate swaps to manage the volatility. The Group obtains financing through 
bank borrowings and leasing arrangements. Funding is obtained from bank loan facilities for both short-term 
and long-term requirement. The Group’s policy is to obtain the most favourable interest rate available without 
increasing its foreign currency exposure.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT’D)
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The currency giving rise to this risk is primarily the US Dollar, 
Mexican Peso and Venezuelan Bolivar.
From time to time, the Group manages its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 
entering into forward contracts to cover a portion of its projected expenditures paid in foreign currency. The 
Group accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges.
At the reporting date, the Group’s exposure to foreign currencies is as follows:

The Company has no significant exposure to foreign currencies as at 30 April 2018 and 2017.
Sensitivity analysis
A 10% strengthening of the group entities’ foreign currencies against their respective functional currency at the 
reporting date would have increased (decreased) loss/profit before taxation and equity by the amounts shown 
below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
A 10% weakening of the group entities’ foreign currencies against their respective functional currency would 
have the equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown below, on the basis that all other variables remain 
constant.

DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES (CONT’D)
Financial instruments measured at fair value 
Type
Valuation technique
Forward exchange contracts
Market comparison technique: The fair values are based on brokers’ 
quotes. Fair values reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include 
adjustments to take into account the credit risk of the Group and 
counterparty when appropriate.
Interest rate swaps
Market comparison technique: The fair values are calculated using a 
discounted cash flow analysis based on terms of the swap contracts 
and the observable interest rate curve. Fair values reflect the risk of the 
instrument and include adjustments to take into account the credit risk 
of the Group and counterparty when appropriate.
Commodities contracts
Market comparison technique: The commodities are traded over-
the-counter and are valued based on the Chicago Board of Trade 
quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or corroborated 
by observable market data available from the Energy Information 
Administration. The values of these contracts are based on the daily 
settlement prices published by the exchanges on which the contracts 
are traded.
Financial instruments not measured at fair value 
Type
Valuation technique
Financial liabilities
The fair value of the secured first and second lien term loans are 
calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest 
cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting 
date (Level 2). 
The fair value of the other loans is based on the discounted value of 
expected future cash flows using risk free rates and credit spread ranging 
from 2.0% to 5.3% (30 April 2017: 2.6% to 4.7%) (Level 3).
Other financial assets and liabilities
The notional amounts of financial assets and liabilities with maturity 
of less than one year (including trade and other receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, and trade and other payables) are, because of the 
short period to maturity, assumed to approximate their fair values. All 
other financial assets and liabilities are discounted to determine their fair 
values.
