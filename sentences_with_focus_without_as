Del Monte Philippines bags the 7-Eleven Suppliers Excellence Award Marketing and Customer and Channel Development Teams during their immersion-teambuilding in Del Monte plantation, Bukidnon 30 DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT FY2018 SALES DMPL generated sales of US$2.2 billion in FY2018, lower by 2.5% versus the prior year as higher sales in the Philippines and S&W in Asia and the Middle East were offset by lower sales in the United States and Europe (on lower volume of the cyclical commodity pineapple juice concentrate (PJC) and significantly lower pricing due to oversupply situation in the international market).

In 2017, several assets were sold resulting in a gain of US$0.3 million recognised in Other income (expenses) net in the income statement of the Group.

Sources of estimation uncertainty As of 30 April 2018, deferred tax assets amounting to US$119.6 million (30 April 2017: US$138.3 million) have been recognised in respect of the tax loss carry forwards because management assessed that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which DMFI can utilise these benefits.

Derivatives The derivatives are entered into with banks and financial institutions which are regulated.

The valuation of biological assets was significant to our audit because the estimation process is complex, involves significant management estimate, and is based on assumptions that can be affected by natural phenomena.

Additionally, each US-based manufacturing facility donates to local food banks on a regular basis.

The Company and Group is still assessing and has not yet reasonably estimated the quantitative impact on its financial statements resulting from the new impairment requirements of IFRS 9.

These estimates and assumptions directly influence the amount of the pension assets/ liabilities and expense recognised in the financial statements.

Other financial assets and liabilities The notional amounts of financial assets and liabilities with maturity of less than one year (including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other payables) are, because of the short period to maturity, assumed to approximate their fair values.

Profitability was impacted by unfavourable USDA and foodservice pricing in the USA, unfavourable sales mix and significantly lower industrial PJC pricing in the international market.

Loans and receivables The Group considers evidence of impairment for loans and receivables at both a specific asset and collective level.

An estimate is made of the future profitability, cash flow, financial health and near-term business outlook of the subsidiary, including factors such as market demand and performance.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Management believes that the Group has control over DTMTDI since it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over DMTDI.

EBITDA AND NET PROFIT DMPLs EBITDA of US$102.3 million was lower by 47.3%.

Estimating the VIU requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and apply an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.

In addition, the estimation of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment is based on collective assessment of industry practice, internal technical evaluation and experiences with similar assets.

As part of the Groups strategy to improve operational excellence and profitability, DMFI divested its underperforming Sager Creek vegetable business in the second quarter of FY2018.

(vii) Share-based payment transactions The Group grants share awards and share options to employees of the Group.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in the market interest rates.

The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.

PREFERENCE SHARE OFFERING In December 2017, the Company successfully completed the offering and listing of its second tranche of Preference Shares (Series A-2) in the Philippines generating US$100 million in proceeds for a combined US$300 million approximately for 2017, including the US$200 million (Series A-1) raised in April 2017.

The Group plans to adopt the standard retrospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognised at the date of initial application (cumulative effect method).

As of 30 April 2018, the number of outstanding ESOP options is nil due to the lapse of its exercise period.

The annual impairment tests are significant to our audit because the valuation process is complex, involves significant management judgment and estimates based on assumptions that can be affected by future market and economic conditions as well as trademark and royalty rates in the market.

A corresponding reduction against past service cost was recognised as part of General and administrative expenses account in the 2016 income statement of the Group.

This loan purchase is in line with the Companys plan to delever its balance sheet and improve the capital structure and profitability of the DMPL Group, through a reduction in effective interest expense of US$8- 10 million per annum and savings from the purchase price discount for the Second Lien Term Loans.

However, for EBITDA calculation, the Group retained the old calculation using the lower depreciation for comparability.

Source of estimation uncertainty Accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation is determined using certain actuarial estimates and assumptions relating to the annual rate(s) of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided by the post- retirement benefit plans due to factors other than changes in the composition of the plan population by age and dependency status, for each year from the measurement date until the end of the period in which benefits are expected to be paid.

Its significant head start versus competition also allowed the brand to win big behind more competitive pricing, improved dominant on-shelf impact in the modern trade, and expanded distribution in the secondary and tertiary trade channels.
