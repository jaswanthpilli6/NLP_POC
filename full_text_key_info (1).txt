DMPL’s fiscal year ends in April in line with its USA subsidiary Del Monte Foods, Inc. For 2013, fiscal year was ending December.
2 
DMPL adopted amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 (Agriculture: Bearer Plants in April 2017). The change in accounting standard was applied retrospectively. 
This involved reclassifying a portion of biological assets to plant, property and equipment leading to much higher depreciation expense. However, for EBITDA 
calculation, the Group retained the old calculation using the lower depreciation for comparability.
3 
The profitability of the Group from CY2013-FY2018 had been impacted by non-recurring items mostly in the USA. Please refer to the Operating and Financial 
Review section for more details.
4 
EPS is calculated as earnings after preference share dividends resulting in a negative figure in FY2018.
5 
DMPL ordinary shares were listed on 2 August 1999 on the Singapore Exchange and on 10 June 2013 on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). Singapore share 
prices are converted to US cents for the purpose of computing financial ratios. DMPL did a 2:10 Bonus Issue with ex-date of 9 April 2013. It also did a Rights 
Issue in March 2015. New shares issued resulted in a 33% dilution.

Preference Shares started trading on the PSE on 7 April 2017 for Series A-1 and on 15 December 2017 for Series A-2.

ANNUAL REPORT FY2018

LETTER TO
SHAREHOLDERS
7. Renewable energy: We 
will leverage alternative, 
renewable sources 
of energy, amidst 
rising energy costs. 
Our waste-to-energy 
facility in the Philippines 
reduced electricity 
cost by over 20%, 
reducing dependence 
on more expensive, less 
sustainable sources of 
energy. 
These are examples of 
how we innovate our 
businesses and processes. 
We aspire to achieve 
better results and cannot 
do more of the same. We 
need to cultivate a mindset 
that is constantly seeking 
more effi  cient and more 
effective ways of achieving 
better results.
FY2018 RESULTS
Our Group generated 
sales of US$2.2 billion 
in FY2018, down 2.5% 
from prior year on higher 
Philippines and S&W Asia 
sales, offset by lower US 
and Europe sales.
Sales in the USA were 
down by 2.5% largely due 
to lower canned tomato 
sales, and unfavourable 
pricing in foodservice 
and US Department 
of Agriculture (USDA). 
We are deprioritising 
low-margin, non-core 
businesses of USDA and 
private label, and focusing 
on more value-added, 
less commoditised 
products both in retail and 
foodservice.
Our Philippine business 
delivered record sales of 
US$333.8 million, up 7% in 
peso terms as all product 
categories – packaged 
fruit, beverage and culinary 
– posted higher sales, 
while the fastest-growing 
foodservice channel 
continued to expand. 
Sales of the S&W business 
in Asia and the Middle East 
reached a record US$106.1 
million, 6% higher due 
to strong double-digit 
growth of the S&W Sweet 
16 fresh pineapple, mainly 
in North Asia.
Sales at our Indian joint 
venture (JV) FieldFresh 
Foods, which are equity 
accounted, were US$76.2 
million in FY2018 driven 
by the 10% growth of 
the Del Monte business. 
FieldFresh sustained its 
positive EBITDA while our 
Company’s share of loss 
in the JV was much lower 
at only US$0.3 million, 
nearing breakeven.
Without one-off items, the 
Group generated EBITDA 
of US$165.0 million, down 
22%, and net profit of 
US$12.0 million, down 
74%. Profitability was 
impacted by unfavourable 
USDA and foodservice 
pricing in the USA, 
unfavourable sales mix 
and significantly lower 
industrial PJC pricing in 
the international market. 
The Group has been 
shifting to more branded 
consumer beverage given 
the volatile nature of 
industrial and commodity 
PJC.
Including one-off items, 
the Group generated 
EBITDA of US$102.3 
million, down 47%, and 
a net loss of US$36.5 
million. One-off expenses 
were incurred in the USA 
due to the planned closure 
of factories to streamline 
operations and become 
cost competitive, and 
write-off of deferred tax 
assets due to the change 
in the US Federal income 
tax rate.
STRATEGY
Del Monte is an iconic 
brand, a household name 
in the United States with 
over 130 years of brand 
heritage. However, as 
with most canned food 
products, we are faced 
with structural declines 
in the industry. Our 
strategy must recognise 
the fundamental changes 
in the marketplace 
and technology for 
consumer goods. 
There are disruptions 
everywhere - in the 
centre store, distribution 
channels, supply 
chains, technological 
developments, consumer 
demographics and 
behaviour.
There has been a 
fundamental shift in how 
people purchase, prepare 
and enjoy their food, and 
the pace of change will 
only intensify. Success will 
require great execution 
against growth strategy 
areas.
We must think “outside 
the can”. We have been 
introducing on-trend 
products in growing 
formats such as cups and 
cartons. We will intensify 
this with a medium-term

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED
ANNUAL REPORT FY2018

LETTER TO
SHAREHOLDERS
7. Renewable energy: We 
will leverage alternative, 
renewable sources 
of energy, amidst 
rising energy costs. 
Our waste-to-energy 
facility in the Philippines 
reduced electricity 
cost by over 20%, 
reducing dependence 
on more expensive, less 
sustainable sources of 
energy. 
These are examples of 
how we innovate our 
businesses and processes. 
We aspire to achieve 
better results and cannot 
do more of the same. We 
need to cultivate a mindset 
that is constantly seeking 
more effi  cient and more 
effective ways of achieving 
better results.
FY2018 RESULTS
Our Group generated 
sales of US$2.2 billion 
in FY2018, down 2.5% 
from prior year on higher 
Philippines and S&W Asia 
sales, offset by lower US 
and Europe sales.
Sales in the USA were 
down by 2.5% largely due 
to lower canned tomato 
sales, and unfavourable 
pricing in foodservice 
and US Department 
of Agriculture (USDA). 
We are deprioritising 
low-margin, non-core 
businesses of USDA and 
private label, and focusing 
on more value-added, 
less commoditised 
products both in retail and 
foodservice.
Our Philippine business 
delivered record sales of 
US$333.8 million, up 7% in 
peso terms as all product 
categories – packaged 
fruit, beverage and culinary 
– posted higher sales, 
while the fastest-growing 
foodservice channel 
continued to expand. 
Sales of the S&W business 
in Asia and the Middle East 
reached a record US$106.1 
million, 6% higher due 
to strong double-digit 
growth of the S&W Sweet 
16 fresh pineapple, mainly 
in North Asia.
Sales at our Indian joint 
venture (JV) FieldFresh 
Foods, which are equity 
accounted, were US$76.2 
million in FY2018 driven 
by the 10% growth of 
the Del Monte business. 
FieldFresh sustained its 
positive EBITDA while our 
Company’s share of loss 
in the JV was much lower 
at only US$0.3 million, 
nearing breakeven.
Without one-off items, the 
Group generated EBITDA 
of US$165.0 million, down 
22%, and net profit of 
US$12.0 million, down 
74%. Profitability was 
impacted by unfavourable 
USDA and foodservice 
pricing in the USA, 
unfavourable sales mix 
and significantly lower 
industrial PJC pricing in 
the international market. 
The Group has been 
shifting to more branded 
consumer beverage given 
the volatile nature of 
industrial and commodity 
PJC.
Including one-off items, 
the Group generated 
EBITDA of US$102.3 
million, down 47%, and 
a net loss of US$36.5 
million. One-off expenses 
were incurred in the USA 
due to the planned closure 
of factories to streamline 
operations and become 
cost competitive, and 
write-off of deferred tax 
assets due to the change 
in the US Federal income 
tax rate.
STRATEGY
Del Monte is an iconic 
brand, a household name 
in the United States with 
over 130 years of brand 
heritage. However, as 
with most canned food 
products, we are faced 
with structural declines 
in the industry. Our 
strategy must recognise 
the fundamental changes 
in the marketplace 
and technology for 
consumer goods. 
There are disruptions 
everywhere - in the 
centre store, distribution 
channels, supply 
chains, technological 
developments, consumer 
demographics and 
behaviour.
There has been a 
fundamental shift in how 
people purchase, prepare 
and enjoy their food, and 
the pace of change will 
only intensify. Success will 
require great execution 
against growth strategy 
areas.
We must think “outside 
the can”. We have been 
introducing on-trend 
products in growing 
formats such as cups and 
cartons. We will intensify 
this with a medium-term 
target of 20% of US sales 
coming from innovation 
from only 1% in FY2018.
We will further develop 
new categories of frozen 
and snacking. We will 
increase the share of 
value-added products 
in both retail and 
foodservice. 
With the Fresh Del 
Monte joint ventures 
on chilled fruit snacks, 
juices, guacamole and 
avocado products, and 
retail F&B, we formed the 
“Perimeter & Convenience 
team” in the US to unlock 
growth opportunities in 
the perimeter of store 
and the rapidly growing 
convenience store 
channel.
FY2018 was a year of 
transition for our US 
business marked by new 
leadership, and an updated 
long-range plan designed 
to build its brands, 
bring differentiated and 
innovative products to 
market, expand channels 
of distribution and 
optimise supply chain.
Our business is well 
positioned vis-à-vis 
the ongoing consumer 
trends for health, wellness 
and nutrition. There is 
latent market demand 
to consume more fruits 
and vegetables. We must 
recognise and seize

INNOVATION
DMPI’s innovation 
strategy has always been 
consistent with its mission 
of bringing to life health 
and wellness. Its most 
successful innovations 
have always been 
anchored on an in-depth 
understanding of unmet 
consumer needs, and 
sometimes, unarticulated 
consumer wants.
The aggressive growth of 
its beverage line in recent 
years, for example, has 
been anchored on new 
news. By pivoting from just 
pure, natural refreshment 
into a consumer-relevant 
functional benefit 
platform, and highlighting 
immunity, detoxification, 
cholesterol management, 
bone strength, weight 
management and 
rehydration across its 
different beverage product 
lines, Del Monte has been 
able to build affi  nity and 
relevance across a broader 
base of consumers and 
across an expanded 
range of consumption 
occasions. 
Packaging format 
innovation has also been 
central to DMPI’s success. 
Its pioneering launch 
of the Stand-Up Pouch 
(SUP) formats in both 
the culinary and fruits 
category not only 
transformed the industry 
traditionally dependent 
on expensive and bulky 
can formats. Its significant 
head start versus 
competition also allowed 
the brand to win big 
behind more competitive 
pricing, improved 
dominant on-shelf impact 
in the modern trade, and 
expanded distribution in 
the secondary and tertiary 
trade channels.
In more recent periods, its 
launch of the 1-litre carton 
format for beverages 
reignited consumer 
interest and generated 
resurgent growth for 
the multi-serve segment 
which has been previously 
decelerating due to 
inconvenient and bulky 
can formats. 
AWARDS AND 
RECOGNITION
The Philippine Market 
team has been awarded

times, attesting to its 
standards of excellence, 
including the following

THE ROAD TO 
PROFITABILITY
As FieldFresh has 
successfully scaled up its 
business, it has begun to 
generate positive EBITDA 
in recent years. Since 
2009, the company has 
grown its Del Monte brand 
footprint across product 
categories, channels, cities 
and consumers across 
India directed by the vision 
and commitment of its 
joint venture partners, and 
the sustained execution of 
its leadership team.
For the coming years, 
FieldFresh will intensify its 
focus on adding healthier 
variants of products in line 
with consumption trends. 
Some of its products such 
as juices and olive oil are 
naturally aligned towards 
health. It will endeavour to 
make a stronger statement 
in the health and wellness 
space, which is an 
important commitment 
for FieldFresh as a food 
company. This may 
include bringing in 
products from the global 
portfolio of Del Monte 
Pacific.
While FieldFresh focuses 
on growing its retail 
distribution directly in the 
top 50 cities, the company 
is focusing on widening 
its indirect distribution 
in other regions through 
wholesale distributors and 
super stockists. Given the 
huge potential for growth 
in India, FieldFresh will 
continue to target strong 
double-digit sales growth 
for the next few years.

exponentially from less 
than a million boxes to 
over 12 million boxes in 
FY2018. Our sales volume 
has increased more than 
12 times in 12 years.
The demand for fresh 
pineapple continues 
to exceed supply as 
consumers move towards 
more natural food with a 
heightened awareness of 
nutrition, rising purchasing 
power, a higher 
predisposition to consume 
fresh and the superior 
sweet taste of MD2 
pineapple. The market 
continues to expand and 
sustain the price of fresh 
pineapple.
Addressing this consumer 
trend, S&W has been 
expanding its supply of 
the MD2 variety of fresh 
pineapple. This is the 
most sought after variety, 
commonly known as 
golden pineapples in the 
premium market, with its 
exceptional sweetness 
and golden colour. S&W 
brands its MD2 pineapple 
as “Sweet 16” after the brix 
or sweetness of the fruit. 
Our Plantation Director 
is from Costa Rica, which 
as a country grows the 
largest area of the MD2 
variety, followed by the 
Philippines. He joined in 
2010 to spearhead the 
expansion of Sweet 16 and 
match the gold standard 
of Costa Rica. S&W’s 
quality is on par with the 
best. 
The growth of S&W’s 
fresh business has been 
sustained not only by the 
growing demand for fresh 
but also by the expansion 
of our capacity to supply 
the market with consistent 
high quality of fresh fruit.
The increased supply of 
MD2 pineapple was made 
possible by the expansion 
of the overall hectarage 
of the plantation within 
the past decade and 
by the strategic and 
deliberate conversion 
of highly productive 
plantation fields from 
champaka pineapple, 
the principal variety 
historically grown by the 
Company for canning 
or processing, to the 
MD2 variety for the fresh 
market. Therefore, while 
the area of the plantation 
has increased during this 
period by about 30% 
to 25,000 hectares, the 
area planted to MD2 has 
increased approximately 
10-fold, coupled with 
improvements in yield 
and the proportion of 
exportable quality of 
fresh pineapples. This 
conversion has been 
transformational to the 
Group in terms of revenue 
growth, margin expansion 
and return on capital.

effi  cient and productive 
land use, carried on from 
our pioneers who started 
farming the land in 1926. 
Across over 90 years of

practices are mainly aimed 
at improving plantation 
yield through ecologically 
friendly land preparation, 
plant disease management 
and chemical application, 
effi  cient water sourcing 
and drainage, and use 
of sustainable planting 
materials.
We installed soil 
conservation measures for 
better soil and drainage 
management, and planted 
trees along river banks 
near pineapple fields. We 
also reinforced technical 
competency through 
continuous training 
and education on soil 
management.
The plantation employs 
agricultural practices to 
mitigate the risk of climate 
change, including El Niño 
and La Niña.

were US$76.2 million 
in FY2018, 5% higher 
versus prior year. US$67.0 
million came from the 
Del Monte-branded 
packaged segment and 
US$9.3 million from the 
FieldFresh-branded fresh 
segment. 
The Del Monte business 
in India was up 10% 
on continued product 
innovation, as well as 
trade, marketing and 
digital campaigns. Building 
on the success of the 
Del Monte Mayonnaise 
spout pack format, the JV 
launched the Del Monte 
Sandwich Spread and Del

in stand up spout packs. 
The business saw growth 
in the pasta and pizza 
sauce category within 
four months of launch. 
Riding on the domestic 
pasta category’s high 
growth, it also introduced 
the domestic pasta 200-

In 2017, Del Monte also 
entered the 1-litre fruit 
drinks segment with a 
range of eight variants in 
carton format. The initial 
pilot in the north region 
is underway, getting a 
fantastic response and 
gaining fast traction in the

was lower than last year 
and its gross margin 
decreased to 30.4% from 
32.5% due to unfavourable 
sales mix, significantly 
lower PJC pricing in the 
international market, and 
the unfavourable impact 
from revaluation of 
biological assets. 
EBITDA AND NET PROFIT
DMPL’s EBITDA of 
US$102.3 million was 
lower by 47.3%. Half of the 
decline was attributed to 
the reasons mentioned 
above that impacted 
gross profit while half was 
due to one-off expenses 
amounting to US$29.1 
million after deducting the 
one-off gain. 
As part of the Group’s 
strategy to improve 
operational excellence and 
profitability, DMFI divested 
its underperforming Sager 
Creek vegetable business 
in the second quarter of 
FY2018. This involved 
shutting the production 
facility in Siloam Springs, 
Arkansas. DMFI also shut 
its Plymouth, Indiana 
tomato production 
facility in the third quarter 
of FY2018 to improve 
effi  ciency and streamline 
operations. These resulted 
in one-off expenses of 
US$62.7 million pre-tax. 
The one-off expenses also 
included a writedown of 
Sager Creek’s inventory 
which the Group planned 
to dispose of in FY2019. 
DMFI recorded a loss 
of US$9.0 million at 
EBITDA level. DMFI 
successfully executed 
the consolidation of its 
Indiana plant that had just 
been closed into its other 
tomato facility in California 
to improve the overall 
utilisation of packaged 
tomato assets. 
Please refer to the table 
below for the schedule of 
one-off items.
Excluding one-off 
expenses, the Group’s 
EBITDA would have been 
US$165.0 million, 22.1% 
lower versus the recurring

As part of its multiyear restructuring project to streamline operations and improve profitability, the Group closed three plants in the US in FY2017-2018. It also 
shifted to a leaner organisation model in the US to drive channel growth and bring down costs in line with competition, hence, the severance costs.

Please refer to the “Cash Flow and Debt” section in the next page for the purchase of loan in the USA.

The Group wrote off US$39.8m of deferred tax assets at DMFI due to the change in Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Other companies in the US with 
deferred tax assets have similar write-offs due to the reduction in income tax rates. However, this should be more than offset by the reduced tax rates in future 
years which will be substantial.
Excluding one-off items, Gross Profit, EBITDA and Net Profit were lower than prior year due to unfavourable sales mix and

As part of its multiyear restructuring project to streamline operations and improve profitability, the Group closed three plants in the US in FY2017-2018. It also 
shifted to a leaner organisation model in the US to drive channel growth and bring down costs in line with competition, hence, the severance costs.

The Group wrote off US$39.8m of deferred tax assets at DMFI due to the change in Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Other companies in the US with 
deferred tax assets have similar write-offs due to the reduction in income tax rates. However, this should be more than offset by the reduced tax rates in future 
years which will be substantial.
Excluding one-off items, Gross Profit, EBITDA and Net Profit were lower than prior year due to unfavourable sales mix and

was lower than last year 
and its gross margin 
decreased to 30.4% from 
32.5% due to unfavourable 
sales mix, significantly 
lower PJC pricing in the 
international market, and 
the unfavourable impact 
from revaluation of 
biological assets. 
EBITDA AND NET PROFIT
DMPL’s EBITDA of 
US$102.3 million was 
lower by 47.3%. Half of the 
decline was attributed to 
the reasons mentioned 
above that impacted 
gross profit while half was 
due to one-off expenses 
amounting to US$29.1 
million after deducting the 
one-off gain. 
As part of the Group’s 
strategy to improve 
operational excellence and 
profitability, DMFI divested 
its underperforming Sager 
Creek vegetable business 
in the second quarter of 
FY2018. This involved 
shutting the production 
facility in Siloam Springs, 
Arkansas. DMFI also shut 
its Plymouth, Indiana 
tomato production 
facility in the third quarter 
of FY2018 to improve 
effi  ciency and streamline 
operations. These resulted 
in one-off expenses of 
US$62.7 million pre-tax. 
The one-off expenses also 
included a writedown of 
Sager Creek’s inventory 
which the Group planned 
to dispose of in FY2019. 
DMFI recorded a loss 
of US$9.0 million at 
EBITDA level. DMFI 
successfully executed 
the consolidation of its 
Indiana plant that had just 
been closed into its other 
tomato facility in California 
to improve the overall 
utilisation of packaged 
tomato assets.

OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
versus prior year period’s 
US$58.9 million mainly 
from unfavourable sales 
mix, reduced export sales 
and much lower PJC 
pricing, and unfavourable 
impact from revaluation of 
biological assets, amongst 
others. 
The DMPL Group 
generated a net loss 
of US$36.5 million for 
the full year of FY2018, 
unfavourable versus prior 
year’s net income of 
US$24.4 million mainly 
due to the one-off 
expenses of US$48.5 
million (post-tax basis). 
Excluding the one-off 
expenses, the Group’s 
net income would have 
been US$12.0 million, 
lower versus the recurring 
net income last year of 
US$45.5 million mainly 
due to higher marketing 
investment in the USA to 
reinvigorate the business 
there in line with the 
Group’s long-range plan, 
lower export sales and 
significantly reduced PJC 
pricing.
FY2018 was a year of 
transition for DMFI marked 
by new leadership, and 
a new long-range plan 
designed to build brands, 
bring differentiated and 
innovative products to 
market, optimise supply 
chain, and expand 
distribution channels. 
Several important 
initiatives were launched 
in FY2018 to improve 
the health of the Group’s 
business in the USA and 
reverse the past several 
years of profit erosion: 
• Reduced Trade Spend 
and Supply Chain Cost 
Reduction projects 
• Deprioritised Margin 
Dilutive Businesses: 
Private label and USDA 
reductions
• Accelerated Innovation: 
New products created 
for centre store and 
perimeter / frozen
• Reduced and Idled 
Excess Production: On 
path to match supply 
with demand
• Focus on Branded 
Share and Distribution 
Growth: Retail and 
Foodservice channels
INVENTORIES
DMPL’s inventories 
amounted to US$761.0 
million as at 30 April 2018, 
lower than the US$916.9 
million as at 30 April 2017 
mainly due to planned 
reduction and divestiture 
of Sager Creek. 
CAPEX
Capital expenditures 
(capex) were US$148.2 
million in FY2018, slightly 
higher than the US$145.0 
million in the prior year. 
DMFI accounted for 
US$37.3 million of Group 
capex in FY2018, lower 
than the US$44.6 million 
in FY2017 due to plant 
closures, while DMPL ex-
DMFI’s capex accounted 
for US$110.8 million, up 
from US$98.4 million in 
FY2017 due to higher 
spending on standing 
crops.
PREFERENCE SHARE 
OFFERING
In December 2017, the 
Company successfully 
completed the offering 
and listing of its second 
tranche of Preference 
Shares (Series A-2) 
in the Philippines 
generating US$100 
million in proceeds for a 
combined US$300 million 
approximately for 2017, 
including the US$200 
million (Series A-1) 
raised in April 2017. The 
Company used the net 
proceeds to substantially 
refinance a US$350 million 
BDO Unibank, Inc loan 
due in February 2019. 
The coupon rate for Series 
A-1 is 6.625% while for 
Series A-2 is 6.5% per 
annum, both payable 
semi-annually.
The Preference Shares 
are redeemable by the 
Company at its option on 
the fifth anniversary.
CASH FLOW AND DEBT
The Group’s cash flow 
from operations in FY2018 
was US$322.9 million, 
significantly higher versus 
prior year’s cash flow of 
US$187.1 million due to 
better working capital 
management, in particular 
the reduction in DMFI’s 
inventory. Improvement in 
cash flow from operations 
contributed to the Group’s 
debt reduction efforts. 
As mentioned above, the 
Company successfully 
completed the offering 
and listing of its second 
tranche of Preference 
Shares in the Philippines 
generating approximately 
US$100 million in 
proceeds. 
As of the Company’s fiscal 
year end April 2018, it 
has also completed the 
purchase from certain 
lenders US$124.9 million 
worth of principal amount

BUSINESS 
OUTLOOK
Barring unforeseen circumstances, 
DMPL is expected to be profitable in 
FY2019.
The Group will focus on 
strengthening its core business, 
while addressing and capitalising 
on changing consumer trends. 
Innovation, through better product 
and packaging development, 
and improved agriculture and 
manufacturing technology, will 
continue to fuel growth initiatives. 
DMPL’s entry into the frozen 
pineapple segment through its joint 
venture with Nice Fruit will be further 
leveraged as the Group brings this 
leading Nice Frozen Dry technology 
and exciting product into new 
markets and applications for both 
retail and foodservice. Please refer 
to pages 36-37 for more information 
on Nice Fruit.
There will be more cross-selling 
across the different markets of the 
Group, bringing products from the 
USA to Asia and vice-versa, and 
more digital opportunities including 
e-commerce for its range of 
products.
It will remain vigilant in keeping 
costs down, amidst an inflationary 
environment and lower pineapple 
juice concentrate pricing, through 
supply chain synergies and G&A cost 
optimisation.
As part of the Group’s deleveraging 
plan, DMPL plans to sell 
approximately 20% of its stake in 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Del Monte 
Philippines, Inc (DMPI), through a 
public offering on the Philippine 
Stock Exchange. The IPO was 
deferred due to volatile market 
conditions. The Company will 
announce as and when it relaunches 
this, subject to better market 
conditions.
USA
The Group faces headwinds from 
the long-term structural decline 
in canned categories in which it 
competes due to shifts in consumer 
preferences, shifts in the way 
American consumers are eating 
and shopping, as well as shifts in 
consumer demographics. 
Its commercial strategy will continue 
to build on its Del Monte brand 
heritage and will realign its business 
with these consumer trends over 
time. Its plan focuses on business 
segments which are on-trend in 
which it will invest in marketing to 
strengthen its leadership positions, 
pursue innovation to address 
growing consumer needs for more 
convenient, healthy and flavourful 
solutions, as well as build its 
distribution base in the growing store 
perimeter and emerging channels. At 
the same time, it will rationalise non-
profitable businesses, in particular 
the low-margin, non-branded 
segment.
With the four new joint ventures 
with Fresh Del Monte Produce 
Inc, the Group has the potential 
to greatly extend the reach of the 
Del Monte brand to the growing 
store perimeter while allowing both 
companies to optimise economies 
of scale. Business plans are being 
executed for chilled prepared fruit 
snacks, while business plans are 
being finalised for chilled juices, 
guacamole and avocado products, 
and Del Monte retail food and 
beverage outlets.
Over time, the product portfolio in 
the USA will no longer just be mostly 
canned but will have increasingly 
meaningful contribution from non-
can formats such as cups, cartons 
and pouches. New categories 
of frozen and snacking will be 
further developed. It will no longer 
focus solely on retail centre-of-
store, but also on retail perimeter,

solutions, as well as build its 
distribution base in the growing store 
perimeter and emerging channels. At 
the same time, it will rationalise non-
profitable businesses, in particular 
the low-margin, non-branded 
segment.
With the four new joint ventures 
with Fresh Del Monte Produce 
Inc, the Group has the potential 
to greatly extend the reach of the 
Del Monte brand to the growing 
store perimeter while allowing both 
companies to optimise economies 
of scale. Business plans are being 
executed for chilled prepared fruit 
snacks, while business plans are 
being finalised for chilled juices, 
guacamole and avocado products, 
and Del Monte retail food and 
beverage outlets.
Over time, the product portfolio in 
the USA will no longer just be mostly 
canned but will have increasingly 
meaningful contribution from non-
can formats such as cups, cartons 
and pouches. New categories 
of frozen and snacking will be 
further developed. It will no longer 
focus solely on retail centre-of-
store, but also on retail perimeter, 
BUILDING A CULTURE OF INNOVATION
DEL MONTE IN RECENT YEARS
A CANNED FOOD COMPANY
Focused on declining centre of the store categories 
and mature retail channels
Portfolio extended into high growth and high margin 
categories sold across diverse channels
Pricing and margin erosion driven by increased trade 
promotion and non-strategic business
Best in class revenue management focused on 
strategically relevant categories 
Bloated supply chain and manufacturing base that 
exceeds demand
Streamlined supply chain (internal and co-pack) 
supporting base demand and growth platforms
Limited innovation and investment to contemporise 
brands (past decade)
Revitalised and strengthened brands supported by 
category-leading innovation and marketing 
Significant decline in profits led by increased COGS 
and lower volumes (past decade)
A disciplined cost containment approach and a 
commitment to pass through net inflation
Lack of internal alignment, communication and 
culture of continuous improvement
A dynamic culture, cross functionally aligned on 
growth, innovation, execution, and continuous 
improvement

• Build Relevance – Drive Our 
Advantage
• Drive Innovation – Think Outside

BACK TO OUR ROOTS
• Market like a brand leader
• Packaging and product innovator
• Leader in plant-based goodness

ASIA
DMPL will continue to expand its 
existing branded business in Asia, 
through the Del Monte brand in the 
Philippines, where it is a dominant 
market leader. S&W, both fresh and 
packaged, will gain more traction as 
it leverages its distribution expansion 
in Asia and the Middle East, while 
the Group’s joint venture in India will 
continue to generate higher branded 
Del Monte sales and maintain its 
positive EBITDA.
PHILIPPINES
In the Philippines, the Group 
will continue to drive increased 
consumption frequency amongst a 
wider base of consumers through 
sustained investments in product 
innovation, advertising, and 
expanded trade availability. 
 
In addition, it expects to take full 
advantage of the fast-growing 
foodservice industry by forging 
strategic tie-ups with key 
foodservice accounts, including 
quick service restaurants and 
convenience stores.
Del Monte has grown with the 
Philippine economy with the trust 
and loyalty of millions of Filipino 
consumers. As the economy 
continues to grow, and the 
Philippine market innovates with 
new healthy products, and expands 
into new channels and market 
segments, it is well positioned to 
grow further. The Philippine market 
is expected to continue to deliver 
higher revenue and profits with its 
household Del Monte brand.
ASIA THROUGH S&W
The significant expansion of S&W 
in recent years has been driven by 
rising demand for fresh pineapples 
and sustained by increased supply 
of high quality fresh pineapples from 
the Group’s plantation in Bukidnon, 
Philippines. The Group will continue 
to leverage this fast-growing, high-
margin business in driving revenue 
and profitability.
It will also expand its packaged 
segment through new markets, new 
products (including frozen pineapple 
that has been well-received in 
Japan) and partnerships, while 
growing the base products in retail 
and foodservice channels, as well 
as in e-commerce. Co-branding of 
S&W with St Mamet of France will 
be further developed, and cross-
selling of products and brands from 
the USA and the Philippines to other 
markets in Asia will continue. The 
S&W team has already brought the 
Group’s US Contadina brand to 
China.
INDIA
FieldFresh, our joint venture 
in India, will intensify its focus 
on adding healthier variants of 
Del Monte products in line with 
consumption trends. Some of its 
products such as juices and olive 
oil are naturally aligned towards 
health. It will endeavour to make 
a stronger statement in the health 
and wellness space, which is an 
important commitment as a food 
company. This may include bringing 
in products from the global portfolio 
of DMPL into India.
While the joint venture focuses on 
growing its retail distribution directly 
in the top 50 cities, it is focusing on 
widening its indirect distribution in 
other regions through wholesale 
distributors and super stockists. 
Given the huge potential for growth 
in India, it will continue to target 
strong double-digit sales growth for 
the next few years.

RISK 
MANAGEMENT
PRINCIPAL RISK
SPECIFIC RISK WE FACE
RISK MITIGATION
Tax
In the Philippines, the government 
passed a new regulation, Tax Reform 
for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN), 
which applies a tax on beverages with 
added sugar, petroleum products and 
coal, among others, which impact the 
cost of operation. Sixty percent of the 
Group’s beverage products, namely 
100% fruit and vegetable juices, are 
not subject to this tax.
The Group may lose certain tax 
incentives should it fail to comply with 
the conditions for the tax incentive.
The Group may be exposed to 
additional losses from write-offs 
of deferred tax credits should the 
operations in the US continue to incur 
losses.
• Implement plans to reduce the impact of the 
sugar tax by spreading the price adjustment across 
categories in order to temper the beverage price 
adjustment and protect consumption and volume
• Optimise production of 100% juice which is 
exempt from the sugar tax and work on product 
reformulation to mitigate the impact
• Work on cost savings from sales, general and 
administrative expense reduction initiatives, 
management of working capital, production 
levels, productivity enhancements and operational 
effi  ciencies
• Implement measures to comply with conditions 
related to the tax incentive
• Proper execution of the Group’s strategic and 
annual operating plan to meet its projected 
income in the US
Operations
As an integrated producer of packaged 
and fresh fruit products for the 
world market, the Group’s earnings 
are inevitably subject to certain 
other risk factors, which include 
general economic and business 
conditions, change in business 
strategy or development plans, 
international business operations, 
production effi  ciencies, input costs 
and availability, disruption of logistics 
and transportation facilities, litigious 
counterparties, insurgent activities and 
changes in government regulations, 
including, but not limited to, 
environmental regulations.
• Develop and execute a long-term strategic plan 
and annual operating plan supported by a business 
continuity plan, risk management and a corporate 
sustainability programme
• Pursue productivity-enhancing and effi  ciency-
generating work practices and capital projects
• Continue to comply with new legislations 
on the environment, regulatory, taxation and 
labour that affect operations and proactively 
develop strategies to reduce the impact of these 
regulations
 • Manage security risks in its operating units in the 
Philippines by strengthening security measures 
and improve its stakeholder relations in the 
communities where it operates
Environmental 
Risks
Production output is subject to 
certain risk factors relating to weather 
conditions, catastrophes, crop yields, 
crop diseases, contract growers and 
service providers’ performance and 
leasehold arrangements.
There is no assurance that natural 
catastrophes or climate change will 
not materially disrupt the Group’s 
business operations in the future or 
that the Group is fully capable to deal 
with these situations with respect to 
all the damages and economic losses 
resulting from these risks.
Our business in the US operates and 
contractually grows food in the United 
States where water availability may 
be at risk due to drought and limited 
water supply, new regulations on fresh 
water use and grey water discharges 
and increasing cost. 
• The Group develops and executes a long-
term strategic plan and annual operating plan, 
supported by a contingency plan and risk 
management measures
• The Group also has in place disaster recovery 
plans and business continuity plans to mitigate 
these incidents and has implemented programmes 
and initiatives to mitigate the effects of climate 
change
• The Group has Good Agricultural Practices 
(G.A.P.) certifications and complies with proven 
agricultural practices
• To manage any impact from heavy rainfall and 
floods, plantings are done in various locations 
to minimise tonnage loss, and towing units have 
been augmented to ensure continuity of harvest 
during wet conditions
• The Group also works with insurance brokers to 
assess the risk exposure and secure adequate 
insurance coverage, if cost effective

Level and Mix of Remuneration
The remuneration of the Company’s Directors and Key Management Personnel has been formulated to attract, retain 
and motivate these executives to run the Company successfully. The level and structure of remuneration are aligned 
with the long-term interests and risk policies of the Company. Relative to industry practice, trends and norms, the 
Company has measurable standards to align the performance-based remuneration of the Executive Directors and 
Key Management Personnel with the long-term interests of the Company.
 
Where appropriate, the RSOC reviews the service contracts of the Company’s Executive Directors and Key Management 
Personnel. 
In reviewing the recommendation for Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration for FY2018, the RSOC continued to 
adopt a framework based on guidelines of the Singapore Institute of Directors, which comprises a base fee, fees for 
membership on Board committees, as well as fees for chairing Board committees. The fees take into consideration 
the amount of time and effort that each Board member is required to devote to their role.

fixed cash and a short term variable bonus. The fixed component includes salary, pension fund contributions and other 
allowances. The variable component comprises a performance-based bonus which is payable upon the achievement 
of individual and corporate performance targets such as revenue and net profit.
Restricted Share Plan/Performance Share Plan:
The Company had two share plans – the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) and the Performance Share Plan (PSP) (collectively 
the Share Plans) which were also administered by the RSOC. The RSP and PSP were long-term incentive schemes 
based on participants achieving pre-set operating unit financial goals, individual performance, as well as achieving 
corporate financial goals in the case of the PSP.
The purpose of the Share Plans was to increase the Company’s flexibility and effectiveness in its continuing efforts 
to reward, retain and motivate employees, currently targeted at executives holding key positions to excel in their 
performance. These were also designed to align the interest of these executives with those of the Company’s 
shareholders. 
Under the Share Plans, shares were delivered after the participant has served the Group for a specific period or after

ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
 
Principle 10
Accountability
There are in place comprehensive management reporting disciplines and structured financial approval authorities to 
govern the implementation of agreed Company policies and Board decisions, including the day-to-day management 
of the Group’s operating units. 
For effective monitoring of the Group’s business and affairs, management and financial information are provided 
to the Board. Information such as disclosure documents, quarterly results, profit and loss statements, cash flow 
statements, working capital requirements and borrowing levels are presented using comparative figures between 
actual results, budgeted levels and prior year’s results.
The Group’s annual budget is reviewed and approved by the Board. A strategic plan, which defines business 
development goals and overall business objectives, is prepared and updated periodically. 
Based on Management’s reports, the Board provides a balanced and fair assessment of the Company’s performance, 
position and prospects for interim reports, other price sensitive public reports and other reports to regulators as 
required.
Principle 11
Internal Controls
The Group maintains an effective system of internal controls addressing financial, operational, compliance and 
information technology (IT) risks. These controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the adequacy, 
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. 
The adequacy and effectiveness of these controls is subject to review by the Group’s Internal Audit department and 
is monitored by the ARC. In addition, the Company’s external auditors also review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
key internal controls as part of their audit for the year with respect to financial reporting. Significant non-compliance 
in internal controls, if any, together with recommendations for improvement, is reported to the ARC. A copy of this 
report is also issued to the relevant department for follow-up action. 
Risk assessment and evaluation takes place as an integral part of the AOP. Having identified key risks to the achievement 
of the Group’s AOP, mitigating actions are formulated in respect of each significant risk. Identified risks are also 
included and monitored in the corporate risk register, and mitigating measures are followed up. The approach to risk 
management is set out in the “Risk Management” section of this Annual Report. 
IT issues are also regularly reported to the Board through the ARC. Reports include matters on business continuity, 
disaster recovery and cybersecurity amongst others. The Board, through the ARC, provides directions on these 
matters which Management executes and Internal Audit monitors. 
Amongst the significant control initiatives that came out of this process is the Cybersecurity Remediation project. This 
initiative is intended to significantly improve the cybersecurity posture of the Company to better manage emerging 
cybersecurity threats.  In FY2017, the Company completed the first phase of the project which involved network 
infrastructure upgrade, restructuring and segmentation, installation of advanced persistent threat protection systems, 
updating and developing the IT security policy and awareness programme. In FY2018, the Company started rolling 
out the implementation of the second phase which involved the adaptation of data loss protection and encryption 
systems, advanced persistent threat protection for end-point systems, and the development and implementation of 
the cybersecurity and awareness programme which will be fully completed within FY2019.

Key Audit Matters (Cont’d)
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the matter
Fair value of biological assets 
The gain on changes in the fair value of produce prior 
to harvest and harvested produce amounted to US$45.1 
million for the year ended 30 April 2018.
The valuation of biological assets was significant to our 
audit because the estimation process is complex, involves 
significant management estimate, and is based on 
assumptions that can be affected by natural phenomena. 
The key assumptions for the fair value of harvested 
produce include selling prices and gross margins. The key 
assumptions for the fair value of produce prior to harvest 
include future selling prices, gross margin, estimated 
tonnage of harvests and future growing costs.
Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements.
We obtained an understanding of management’s fair value 
measurement methodology and their process in valuing 
the biological assets. We tested the key assumptions 
used in the valuation, which include selling prices and 
gross margin for harvested produce; and future selling 
prices, gross margin, estimated tonnage of harvests and 
future growing costs for produce prior to harvest, by 
comparing them to external data such as selling prices in 
the principal market and historical information. We also 
assessed the methodology used in estimating the fair 
value. 
 
We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures 
on the assumptions underlying the measurement of 
these biological assets.
Recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life trademarks
As at 30 April 2018, goodwill is carried at US$203.4 
million, which represents 14% of the total non-current 
assets. Indefinite life trademarks were carried at US$408.0 
million, which represents 27% of the total non-current 
assets.
(a) Goodwill and indefinite life trademarks allocated to 
Del Monte Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries
The Group’s goodwill is allocated to a Cash Generating 
Unit (CGU), Del Monte Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
Included within the CGU are the indefinite life trademarks 
“Del Monte” and “College Inn” in the United States of 
America (USA) amounting to US$394.0 million. The 
Group uses the value in use calculation to estimate the 
recoverable value of the CGU. 
The annual impairment test is significant to our audit 
because the valuation process is complex, involves 
significant management judgement, and is based on 
certain key assumptions, such as cash flow projections 
covering a five-year period and the long-term growth 
rate and discount rate of the CGU.
Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements.
We obtained an understanding of the Group’s impairment 
assessment process and the related controls. We tested 
the reasonableness of the key assumptions, which include 
revenue growth, gross margin and EBITDA margin, 
discount rate, long-term growth rate by comparing 
them to available market and historical information and 
management plans. 
Given the complexity of the valuation process, our 
internal valuation specialist was involved in performing 
some of these procedures. 
We also focused on the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in Note 8 to the financial statements, 
about those assumptions to which the outcome of the 
impairment test was most sensitive, that is, those that 
have the most significant effect on the determination of 
the recoverable amount of the CGU.

significant management judgment and estimates based 
on assumptions that can be affected by future market 
and economic conditions as well as trademark and 
royalty rates in the market.
The Group used the Royalty Savings Approach in valuing 
its Philippines and Asia S&W trademarks. This approach 
relies on the forecasted revenue for the related brand or 
trademark and applies the royalty rates in the market. For 
the India trademark, the Group used the discounted cash 
flow of the related CGU. This method relies on forecasted 
financial results which uses significant assumptions such 
as revenue growth rates, EBITDA and long-term margins, 
terminal value growth rate and discount rate. 
Refer to Notes 7 and 8 to the financial statements.
We assessed the reasonableness of the forecasted 
revenue and royalty rates used to derive the recoverable 
value of the brand and trademarks by comparing against 
available market and historical information. 
We also evaluated the significant assumptions used in 
the financial forecast of the CGU, which include revenue 
growth rates, EBITDA and long-term margins, terminal 
value growth rate and discount rate, by comparing them 
against available market information, historical data and 
management plans.
Given the complexity of the valuation process, our 
internal specialist was involved in performing some of 
these procedures. 
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
As at 30 April 2018, the Group has recognized net deferred 
tax assets of US$79.8 million, which includes deferred tax 
assets recognized by Del Monte Foods, Inc., a subsidiary 
in the United States of America (USA), amounting to 
US$77.8 million. 
The recoverability of the deferred tax asset was significant 
to our audit because it involves significant management 
judgment and is based on assumptions that are affected 
by future market or economic conditions. The key 
assumptions in the taxable income forecast include 
revenue growth rates and gross and EBITDA margins.
Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements.
We assessed the recognition of deferred tax assets by 
comparing it to the taxable income forecast. We tested 
the key assumptions in the taxable income forecast such 
as revenue growth rates and gross and EBITDA margins 
against available market information, management plans, 
historical performance and industry/market outlook. We 
compared the consistency of management's taxable 
income forecasts with those included in the budget 
approved by the Board of Directors.
We assessed the robustness of management’s forecasting 
process by comparing the actual results of the subsidiary 
against the forecast used in prior year.  
We involved our internal specialist in reviewing the 
temporary differences.

GOING CONCERN – THE COMPANY
The Company’s current liabilities are higher by US$109.2 million compared to current assets as at 30 April 2018 
(30 April 2017: US$34.7 million). 
Management believes that the Company will be able to pay its liabilities as and when they fall due. Accordingly, 
the use of going concern assumption is appropriate taking into account the following:
• 
the Group’s net current assets position of US$227.2 million as at 30 April 2018 (30 April 2017: US$433.7 
million) and the Company expects dividend payment from its subsidiaries;
• 
the Group and the Company is getting new lines with banks for a period of more than 12 months. 
Additionally, the Group continues to improve debt-equity ratio and bring the same down through 
raising additional equity.

BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONT’D)
3.5 
Measurement of fair value (cont’d)
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole:
• 
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can 
access at the measurement date.
• 
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly.
• 
Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value 
hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value 
hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. 
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period 
during which the change has occurred.
3.6 
Adoption of New or Revised Standards, Amendments to Standards and Interpretations
The Group applied for the first time certain pronouncements, which are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 May 2017. 
Amendments to IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, Clarification of the Scope of the Standard 
(Part of Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 – 2016 Cycle). The amendments clarify that the disclosure 
requirements in IFRS 12, other than those relating to summarized financial information, apply to an entity’s 
interest in a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate (or a portion of its interest in a joint venture or an 
associate) that is classified (or included in a disposal group that is classified) as held for sale. Adoption of these 
amendments did not have any impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows, Disclosure Initiative. The amendments require entities to 
provide disclosure of changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising 
from cash flows and non-cash changes (such as foreign exchange gains or losses). 
The Group has provided the required information in Note 40 to the consolidated financial statements. As 
allowed under the transition provisions of the standard, the Group did not present comparative information for 
the year ended 30 April 2017.
Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes, Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses. The 
amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits 
against which it may make deductions upon the reversal of the deductible temporary difference related to 
unrealised losses. Furthermore, the amendments provide guidance on how an entity should determine future 
taxable profits and explain the circumstances in which taxable profit may include the recovery of some assets 
for more than their carrying amount. The amendments have no significant effect on the Group’s financial 
position and performance.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 
statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities, except as explained in Note 3.6, which 
addresses the changes in accounting policies.
4.1 
Basis of consolidation
(i) 
Business combination
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 as at 
the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• 
the fair value of consideration transferred; plus
• 
the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• 
if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest 
in the acquiree, 
over the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing 
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in the income statement.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included in 
the consideration transferred. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured 
and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement.
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets, at the acquisition date. The measurement basis taken is elected on a transaction-by-
transaction basis. All other components of non-controlling interests are measured at acquisition-date 
fair value unless another measurement is required by another standard.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, 
that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period 
it occurs, provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete is reported in the 
financial statements. During the measurement period, which is not more than one year from acquisition 
date, the provisional amounts recognised are retrospectively adjusted, and any additional assets or 
liabilities recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as 
of the acquisition date. Comparative information for prior periods are revised, as needed.

Business combination
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 as at 
the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• 
the fair value of consideration transferred; plus
• 
the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• 
if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest

over the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing 
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in the income statement.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included in 
the consideration transferred. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured 
and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement.
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets, at the acquisition date. The measurement basis taken is elected on a transaction-by-

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
4.1 
Basis of consolidation (cont’d)
(i) 
Business combination (cont’d)
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted 
for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to 
goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Adjustments to non-controlling 
interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate 
amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
(ii) 
Investments in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved when the Company is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through power over the investee. Specifically, the Company controls an investee if and only if 
the Company has:
• 
power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee);
• 
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• 
the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Company has less than majority of the voting rights or similar rights to an investee, the 
Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an 
investee, including:
• 
the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;
• 
rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
• 
the Company’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that 
there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date control is transferred to the Company and cease to be consolidated from the date control 
is lost. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the income statement from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company 
ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity 
holders of the Company and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling 
interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Company’s accounting policies. 
All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income expenses and cash flows relating to transactions 
between members of the Company are eliminated in full on consolidation.
(iii) 
Acquisition under common control
The formation of the Group in 1999 was accounted for as a reorganisation of companies under common 
control using merger accounting. The financial statements therefore reflect the combined financial 
statements of all companies that form the Group as if they were a Group for all periods presented. 
The assets and liabilities of Del Monte Pacific Resources Limited and its subsidiaries contributed to the 
Company have been reflected at predecessor cost in these financial statements.

(i) 
Business combination (cont’d)
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted 
for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to 
goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Adjustments to non-controlling 
interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate 
amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
(ii) 
Investments in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved when the Company is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through power over the investee. Specifically, the Company controls an investee if and only if 
the Company has:
• 
power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee);
• 
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• 
the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, 
and any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in the income statement.
(v) 
Goodwill
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For the 
measurement of goodwill on initial recognition, see Note 8
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of the joint ventures, the 
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment 
loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the 
carrying amount of the joint ventures. 
Impairment of goodwill is discussed in Note 4.11.
(vi) 
Investments in joint ventures
Joint ventures are those entities in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to 
the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint 
control is the contractually sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those 
necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially 
at cost, which includes transactions costs. 
Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial statements include the Group’s share of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income of the joint ventures, after adjustments to align the accounting 
policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences 
until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. 
 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in joint ventures, the carrying amount of the 
investment, together with any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the 
recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to 
fund the investee’s operations or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
Impairment of investments in joint ventures is discussed in Note 4.11.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the 
foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) in equity. However, if the operation is a 
non-wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is 
allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, or 
joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation 
is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the group disposes of only 
part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant 
proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group 
disposes of only part of its investment in joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining 
significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to 
the income statement.
When the settlement of a monetary item that is a receivable from or payable to a foreign operation 
is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from 
such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are 
recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity.

Current versus noncurrent classification 
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current and noncurrent 
classification. An asset is current when:
• 
It is expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle
• 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
• 
It is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period, or
• 
It is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least 12 months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as noncurrent. 
A liability is current when:
• 
It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle
• 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
• 
It is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period, or
• 
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
reporting period.
The Group classifies all other liabilities as noncurrent.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.

Financial instruments
The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVPL), held-to-maturity (HTM) financial assets, loans and receivables and available-for-
sale (AFS) financial assets. The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the following categories: 
financial liabilities at FVPL and other financial liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which 
the investments were acquired and whether they are quoted in an active market. Classification is determined at 
initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates such designation at every reporting date. 
The Group has no financial assets and liabilities at FVPL, HTM financial assets, and AFS financial assets as at 30 
April 2018 and 2017, and 2016.
 
(i) 
Non-derivative financial assets
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. 
All other financial assets are recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset 
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction 
in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain 
control over the transferred asset. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained 
by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial 
position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to 
settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group assesses that 
it has a currently enforceable right of offset if the right is not contingent on a future event, and is legally 
enforceable in the normal course of business, event of default, and event of insolvency or bankruptcy 
of the Group and all of the counterparties.
 
Non-derivative financial assets comprise of loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables comprise of due from a related party, note receivable under “Other noncurrent

equivalents comprise of cash on hand, cash in banks and short-term placements. 
(ii)

Non-derivative financial liabilities (cont’d)
When a financial liability (or part of a liability) is extinguished, the difference between the carrying 
amount of the financial liability (or part of a liability) and the consideration paid, including any non-cash 
assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in income statement. If the Group repurchases 
only a part of a financial liability, it calculates the carrying value of the part disposed of by allocating 
the previous carrying amount of the financial liability between the part that continues to be recognised 
and the part that is derecognised based on the relative fair values of those parts on the date of the 
repurchase.
The Group assesses that it has a currently enforceable right of offset if the right is not contingent on a 
future event, and is legally enforceable in the normal course of business, event of default, and event of 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and all of the counterparties.
Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using

Non-derivative financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
(iii) 
Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing risks associated with interest 
rates, currencies, transportation and certain commodities. The Group does not trade or use instruments 
with the objective of earning financial gains on fluctuations in the derivative instrument alone, nor does 
it use instruments where there are no underlying exposures. All derivative instruments are recorded in 
the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or 
losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated and qualifies 
as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative 
instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Group designates the hedging 
instrument based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge 
of a net investment in a foreign operation.
On initial designation of the derivative as the hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, including the risk management 
objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged risk, together with the 
methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether 
the hedging instruments are expected to be ‘highly effective’ in offsetting the changes in the fair value 
or cash flows of the respective hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, and whether the actual 
results of each hedge are within a range of 80 – 125%. For a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, 
the transaction should be highly probable to occur and should present an exposure to variations in cash 
flows that could ultimately affect reported profit or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised 
in the income statement as they are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured 
at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in the income statement.

as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative 
instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Group designates the hedging 
instrument based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge 
of a net investment in a foreign operation.
On initial designation of the derivative as the hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, including the risk management 
objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged risk, together with the 
methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether 
the hedging instruments are expected to be ‘highly effective’ in offsetting the changes in the fair value 
or cash flows of the respective hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, and whether the actual 
results of each hedge are within a range of 80 – 125%. For a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, 
the transaction should be highly probable to occur and should present an exposure to variations in cash 
flows that could ultimately affect reported profit or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised 
in the income statement as they are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured 
at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in the income statement.

Non-derivative financial liabilities (cont’d)
When a financial liability (or part of a liability) is extinguished, the difference between the carrying 
amount of the financial liability (or part of a liability) and the consideration paid, including any non-cash 
assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in income statement. If the Group repurchases 
only a part of a financial liability, it calculates the carrying value of the part disposed of by allocating 
the previous carrying amount of the financial liability between the part that continues to be recognised 
and the part that is derecognised based on the relative fair values of those parts on the date of the 
repurchase.
The Group assesses that it has a currently enforceable right of offset if the right is not contingent on a 
future event, and is legally enforceable in the normal course of business, event of default, and event of 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and all of the counterparties.
Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Non-derivative financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
(iii) 
Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing risks associated with interest 
rates, currencies, transportation and certain commodities. The Group does not trade or use instruments 
with the objective of earning financial gains on fluctuations in the derivative instrument alone, nor does 
it use instruments where there are no underlying exposures. All derivative instruments are recorded in 
the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or 
losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated and qualifies

Cash flow hedges
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes 
in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
The amount accumulated in equity is retained in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit 
or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If 
the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in equity is 
reclassified to the income statement.

Property, plant and equipment
(i) 
Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses except for freehold land, which are stated at its revalued amounts. The 
revalued amount is the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated impairment 
losses. Revaluation is carried out by independent professional valuers regularly such that the carrying 
amount of these assets does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair values 
at the reporting date. 
Any increase in the revaluation amount is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in 
the revaluation reserve in equity unless it offsets a previous decrease in value of the same asset that was 
recognised in the income statement. A decrease in value is recognised in the income statement where 
it exceeds the increase previously recognised in the revaluation reserve. Upon disposal, any related 
revaluation reserve is transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings and is not 
taken into account in arriving at the gain or loss on disposal.
A bearer plant is a pineapple and papaya living plant that is used in the production or supply of agricultural 
produce, is expected to bear produce for more than one period and has a remote likelihood of being 
sold as agricultural produce, except for incidental scrap sales
Costs related to bearer plants are capitalised up to point of maturity of the bearer plants, including costs 
during the ratoon crop cycle. These costs include land preparation, cultural, spraying and plantation 
overhead costs.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-
constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable 
to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, when the Group has an obligation 
to remove the asset or restore the site as estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items 
and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased software 
that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

Recognition and measurement (cont’d)
Construction in-progress represents plant and properties under construction or development and 
is stated at cost. This includes cost of construction, plant and equipment, borrowing costs directly 
attributable to such asset during the construction period and other direct costs. Construction in-
progress is not depreciated until such time when the relevant assets are substantially completed and 
available for its intended use.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted 
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing 
the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the item, and is recognised net within other 
income/other expenses in the income statement.
(ii) 
Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the 
carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the 
component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the 
replaced component is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and 
equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
(iii) 
Depreciation
Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual 
assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, 
that component is depreciated separately.
Depreciation (except bearer plants) is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment, unless it is 
included in the carrying amount of another asset. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by 
the end of the lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and are 
ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed 
and ready for use.
For bearer plants, units of production method is used. Depreciation is charged according to the cost of 
fruits harvested at plant crop and ratoon crop harvest months. 
The estimated useful lives for the current period and comparative years are as follows:
Buildings, land improvements and 
– 
3 to 50 years or lease term, 
 leasehold improvements 
 
 
whichever is shorter  
Machineries and equipment  
– 
3 to 30 years
Bearer plants are depreciated based on the ratio of actual quantity of harvest over the estimated yield 
for both plant crop and ratoon crop harvests. Plant crop harvest usually occurs within 16 to 18 months 
after planting while ratoon crop harvest occurs at the 32nd to 34th month after planting. Depreciation is 
determined on a per field basis. 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted 
if appropriate.

The Group’s biological assets include: (a) bearer plants consisting of pineapple and papaya and its harvested 
and unharvested agricultural produce; (b) breeding and dairy herd; (c) growing herd; and (d) cattle for slaughter 
and cut meat from these cattle. 
The Group’s biological assets are accounted for as follows: 
Bearer Plants
Bearer plants are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation recognised at point of harvest. Bearer 
plants are presented as part of property, plant and equipment. Costs to grow include purchase cost of various 
chemicals and fertilizers, land preparation expenses and direct expenses during the cultivation of the primary 
ratoon and, if needed, re-ratoon crops. The accumulated costs are deferred and are amortised as raw product 
costs upon harvest. Raw product cost is recognised as depreciation based on the actual volume of harvest in 
a given period. 
Units-of-production method is used for depreciating the bearer plants. Depreciation is charged according to 
the cost of fruits harvested at plant crop and ratoon crop harvest months.
Bearer plants are depreciated based on the ratio of actual quantity of harvest over the estimated yield for both 
plant crop and ratoon crop harvests. Plant crop harvest usually occurs within 16 to 18 months after planting 
while ratoon crop occurs at the 32nd to 34th month after planting. Depreciation is determined on a per field 
basis. 
Breeding and Dairy Herd
The breeding and dairy herd are measured at cost. The breeding and dairy herd have useful lives of 3 ½ to  
6 years. The cost method was used since fair value cannot be measured reliably. The breeding and dairy herd 
have no active markets and no similar assets are available in the relevant markets. In addition, existing sector 
benchmarks are irrelevant and estimates necessary to compute for the present value of expected net cash 
flows comprise a wide range of data which will not result in a reliable basis for determining the fair value. 
Breeding and dairy herd are classified as noncurrent assets in the statement of financial position of the Group.
Growing Herd
Growing herd is measured at cost. The cost method was used since the fair value cannot be measured reliably. 
Growing herd has no defined active market since it has not yet been identified if this will be for breeding or for 
slaughter. Growing herd is classified as noncurrent assets in the statement of financial position of the Group.
Cattle for Slaughter
Cattle for slaughter is measured at each reporting date at their fair value less point-of-sale costs. Gains and 
losses arising from changes in fair values are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise. Cattle 
for slaughter is classified as noncurrent assets in the statements of financial position of the Group.

The Group’s agricultural produce are accounted for as follows: 
Agricultural Produce
The Group’s growing produce are measured at their fair value from the time of maturity of the bearer plant 
until harvest. The Group uses the future selling prices and gross margin of finished goods, adjusted to remove 
the margin associated to further processing, less future growing cost as the basis of fair value. The Group’s 
harvested produce to be used in processed products are measured at fair value at the point of harvest based on 
the estimated selling prices reduced by cost to sell and adjusted for margin associated to further processing. 
The Group’s harvested produce to be sold as fresh fruits are measured at fair value at the point of harvest based 
on the average selling price of fresh fruit reduced by cost to sell.
Cutmeat
Cutmeat is measured at each reporting date at their fair value less point-of-sale costs. Gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair values are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.

Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the 
arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the 
use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made 
after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies:
(a) 
There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement;
(b) 
A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless that term of the renewal or extension was 
initially included in the lease term;
(c) 
There is a change in the determination of whether fulfillment is dependent on a specified asset; or
(d) 
There is a substantial change to the asset.
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change 
in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios (a), (c) or (d) above, and at the date of renewal or 
extension period for scenario (b).
A series of transactions that involve the legal form of a lease is linked and is accounted for as one transaction 
when the overall economic effect cannot be understood without reference to the series of transactions as a 
whole. This is the case, for example, when the series of transactions are closely interrelated, negotiated as a 
single transaction, and takes place concurrently or in a continuous sequence. This requires an evaluation of 
the substance of the lease arrangement, including the conveyance of the right to use an asset for an agreed 
period of time.
Group as Lessee
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased asset are 
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of raw materials, packaging materials, traded goods, cost of production materials and storeroom 
items is based on the FIFO (First-in First-out) method. Cost of processed inventories comprises all costs of 
purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition.
The costs of conversion include costs directly related to the units of production, and a systematic allocation of 
fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods.
The allocation of fixed production overheads is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. 
Normal capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average for the periods or seasons under 
normal circumstances, taking into account the seasonal business cycle of the Group.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs 
of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of growing crops transferred from biological assets is its fair value less cost to sell at the date of 
harvest.

Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amount of

Impairment
(i) 
Non-derivative financial assets 
A financial asset not classified at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective 
evidence indicates that a loss event(s) have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that 
the loss event(s) had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be 
estimated reliably.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired can include default or delinquency by a debtor, 
restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise, 
indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of 
borrowers or issuers in the Group, or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Loans and receivables
The Group considers evidence of impairment for loans and receivables at both a specific asset and 
collective level. All individually significant loans and receivables are assessed for specific impairment. All 
individually significant receivables found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively assessed 
for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified. 
Loans and receivables that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by 
grouping together loans and receivables with similar risk characteristics.

Impairment (cont’d)
(i) 
Non-derivative financial assets (cont’d)
In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, timing 
of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether 
current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or less 
than suggested by historical trends.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the 
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in the income statement 
and reflected in an allowance account against loans and receivables. Interest on the impaired asset 
continues to be recognised. 
When the Group considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant 
amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can 
be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
(ii) 
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than biological assets, inventories and 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, 
and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at 
the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-
generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value-in-use (VIU) and its fair value less 
costs to sell. In assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be 
tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows 
from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGU.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of 
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of 
CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a 
pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses 
recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has 
decreased or no longer exists. 
An impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been 
recognised.

Joint ventures and investments in subsidiaries
An impairment loss in respect of joint ventures is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of 
the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. An 
impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount.
Goodwill
Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in a joint venture is not recognised 
separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the 
investment in a joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence 
that the investment in a joint venture may be impaired.
When conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill, the Group compares the estimated fair value 
of the CGU containing goodwill to its recoverable amount. 
Goodwill is allocated to a CGU or group of CGUs that represents the lowest level within the entity 
at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount is 
computed using two approaches: the value-in-use approach, which is the present value of expected 
cash flows, discounted at a risk adjusted weighted-average cost of capital; and the fair value less cost 
to sell approach, which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. 
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs 
to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is 
performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect 
of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group 
of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill attributable to acquisition of a subsidiary is not reversed.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, are components of the CGU containing goodwill and the 
impairment assessment is as described above.

Noncurrent assets held for sale
Noncurrent assets held for sale are classified as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale 
and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Once classified as held-for-sale, property, plant and equipment are no longer depreciated. If it is no longer 
highly probable that an asset will be recovered primarily through sale, the asset ceases to be classified as held-
for-sale and is measured at the lower of its carrying amount before the asset was classified as held-for-sale 
adjusted for any depreciation that would have been recognised had the asset not been reclassified as held for 
sale and its recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent reclassification. The required adjustment to the 
carrying amount of an asset that ceases to be classified as held-for-sale is included in the consolidated income 
statement. The Group classified certain assets in Plymouth, Indiana and Siloam Springs, Arkansas as held-for-
sale as of 30 April 2018 (see Note 16). The Group did not have any assets held for sale as of 30 April 2017.

Employee benefits
(i) 
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee 
benefit expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
(ii) 
Defined benefit pension plan
A defined benefit pension plan requires contributions to be made to separately administered funds. 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, 
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The Group determines the 
net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the 
discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to 
the net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability 
(asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic 
benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan 
in the Group. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, 
or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
Service costs which include current service costs, past service costs and gains or losses on non-routine 
settlements are recognised as expense in profit or loss.  Past service costs are recognised when plan 
amendment or curtailment occurs.

Noncurrent assets held for sale
Noncurrent assets held for sale are classified as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale 
and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Once classified as held-for-sale, property, plant and equipment are no longer depreciated. If it is no longer 
highly probable that an asset will be recovered primarily through sale, the asset ceases to be classified as held-
for-sale and is measured at the lower of its carrying amount before the asset was classified as held-for-sale 
adjusted for any depreciation that would have been recognised had the asset not been reclassified as held for 
sale and its recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent reclassification. The required adjustment to the 
carrying amount of an asset that ceases to be classified as held-for-sale is included in the consolidated income 
statement. The Group classified certain assets in Plymouth, Indiana and Siloam Springs, Arkansas as held-for-
sale as of 30 April 2018 (see Note 16). The Group did not have any assets held for sale as of 30 April 2017.

Employee benefits
(i) 
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee 
benefit expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
(ii) 
Defined benefit pension plan
A defined benefit pension plan requires contributions to be made to separately administered funds. 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, 
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The Group determines the 
net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the 
discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to 
the net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability 
(asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic 
benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan 
in the Group. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, 
or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
Service costs which include current service costs, past service costs and gains or losses on non-routine 
settlements are recognised as expense in profit or loss.  Past service costs are recognised when plan 
amendment or curtailment occurs.

(ii) 
Defined benefit pension plan (cont’d)
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on 
plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group 
recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all expenses related to defined 
benefit plans in staffcost in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is 
curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the plan amendment or curtailment occurs, the Group recognises gains and losses on the 
settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on settlement is the 
difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on 
the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments 
made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement. In fiscal 2016, a plan amendment was 
implemented for certain medical and dental benefits (see Note 21). 
Multi-employer plans
The Group participates in several multi-employer pension plans, which provide defined benefits 
to certain union employees. The Group accounts for its proportionate share of the defined benefit 
obligation, plan assets and cost associated with the plan in the same way as other defined benefit plan. 
For certain union employee related retirement plans where sufficient information is not available to use 
defined benefit accounting, the Group accounts for these plans as if they were defined contribution 
plans.
(iii) 
Other plans
The Group has various other non-qualified retirement plans and supplemental retirement plans for 
executives, designed to provide benefits in excess of those otherwise permitted under the Group’s 
qualified retirement plans. These plans are unfunded and comply with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
rules for non-qualified plans.
(iv) 
Other long-term employee benefits
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior 
periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any related assets 
is deducted. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method. Any actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
(v) 
Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, 
without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment 
before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to 
encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits are recognised as an expense once the Group 
has announced the plan to affected employees.

Share capital and retained earnings (cont’d)
(i) 
Share capital (cont’d)
Repurchase, disposal and reissue of share capital (treasury shares)
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which 
includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. 
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the reserve for own shares. 
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an 
increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in share premium.
Share premium
Share premium represents the excess of consideration received over the par value of ordinary and 
preference shares net of transaction costs from issuance of share capital, share options exercised and 
released of share awards granted.
 
(ii) 
Retained Earnings
Retained earnings include profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group and reduced by dividends 
declared on share capital. 
(iii) 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from retained earnings when they are declared. 
4.15 
Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
(i) 
Environment remediation liabilities
In accordance with the Group’s environment policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for 
environmental remediation obligations and the related expense is recognised when such losses are 
probable and the amounts of such losses can be estimated reliably. Accruals for estimated losses for 
environmental remediation obligations are recognised no later than the completion of the remedial 
feasibility study. These accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change.
(ii) 
Retained insurance liabilities
The Group accrues for retained insurance risks associated with the deductible portion of any potential 
liabilities that might arise out of claims of employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury 
or property damage occurring in the course of the Group’s operations. 
A third-party actuary is engaged to assist the Group in estimating the ultimate cost of certain retained 
insurance risks. Additionally, the Group’s estimate of retained insurance liabilities is subject to change as 
new events or circumstances develop which might materially impact the ultimate cost to settle these 
losses.

(i) 
Environment remediation liabilities
In accordance with the Group’s environment policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for 
environmental remediation obligations and the related expense is recognised when such losses are 
probable and the amounts of such losses can be estimated reliably. Accruals for estimated losses for 
environmental remediation obligations are recognised no later than the completion of the remedial 
feasibility study. These accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change.
(ii) 
Retained insurance liabilities
The Group accrues for retained insurance risks associated with the deductible portion of any potential 
liabilities that might arise out of claims of employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury 
or property damage occurring in the course of the Group’s operations. 
A third-party actuary is engaged to assist the Group in estimating the ultimate cost of certain retained 
insurance risks. Additionally, the Group’s estimate of retained insurance liabilities is subject to change as 
new events or circumstances develop which might materially impact the ultimate cost to settle these 
losses.

Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the 
customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can 
be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably. If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be 
measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
The timing of transfers of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale but 
usually occurs when the customer receives the product.
Direct trade promotions such as retail store displays, listing fees, and volume incentives are recognised as 
reduction from revenue at the point of sale.
4.17 
Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expenses, 
over the term of the lease.
Rent expense is being recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. The difference between 
rent expense recognised and rental payments, as stipulated in the lease, is reflected as deferred rent in the 
statements of financial position.
4.18 
Finance income and finance costs
Finance income comprises interest income earned mainly from bank deposits and due from a related party of 
the Company. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in the income statement, using the effective interest 
method.
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings. All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss 
using the effective interest method, except to the extent that they are capitalised as being directly attributable 
to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset which necessarily takes a substantial period of time 
to be prepared for its intended use or sale.
Foreign currency gains and losses on financial assets and financial liabilities are reported on a net basis as either 
finance income or finance cost depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a net gain or net 
loss position.
4.19 
Tax
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss 
except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not 
recognised for:
• 
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• 
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• 
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to 
offset current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain 
tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax 
liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations 
of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series 
of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change 
its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax 
expense in the period that such a determination is made.
4.20 
Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is 
calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted-
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted earnings 
per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-
average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares, which comprise the restricted share plan and share options granted to employees.

Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may 
earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any 
of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the 
Group’s Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess 
its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly of non-recurring expenses.

Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is 
calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted-
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted earnings 
per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-
average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares, which comprise the restricted share plan and share options granted to employees.
4.21 
Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may 
earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any 
of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the 
Group’s Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess 
its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly of non-recurring expenses.

Tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not 
recognised for:
• 
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• 
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that the 
Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• 
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to 
offset current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain 
tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax 
liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations 
of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series 
of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change 
its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax 
expense in the period that such a determination is made.

The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) (cont’d)
Classification – Financial assets
IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the 
business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. It contains three 
principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). It eliminates the 
existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.
Based on its assessment, the Company and Group does not believe that the new classification 
requirements will have a material impact on its accounting for trade and other receivables, and notes 
receivable which are expected to be similarly accounted for as at amortised cost.
Impairment
IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) 
model. This will require considerable judgement about how changes in economic factors affect ECLs, 
which will be determined on a probability-weighted basis. The new impairment model will apply to the 
Group’s financial assets measured at amortised cost and any contract assets recognised under IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
Under IFRS 9, loss allowances will be measured on either of the following bases:
• 
12-month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months 
after the reporting date; and
• 
Lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of 
a financial instrument.
Lifetime ECL measurement applies if credit risk of a financial asset at the reporting date has increased 
significantly since initial recognition and 12-month ECL measurement applies if it has not. Lifetime ECL 
measurement always applies for trade receivables and contract assets without a significant financing 
component.
The Company and Group is still assessing and has not yet reasonably estimated the quantitative impact 
on its financial statements resulting from the new impairment requirements of IFRS 9.
Hedge Accounting
When initially applying IFRS 9, there is an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the hedge 
accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the requirements in IFRS 9. The Group expects to apply 
the new requirements of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 requires the Group to ensure that hedge accounting relationships are aligned with the Group’s 
risk management objectives and strategy and to apply a more qualitative and forward-looking approach 
to assessing hedge effectiveness. IFRS 9 also introduces new requirements on rebalancing hedge 
relationships and prohibiting voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting.

The new standard introduces a new and more comprehensive revenue recognition model for contracts 
with customers which specifies that revenue should be recognised when (or as) a company transfers 
control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which the company expects to be entitled.
IFRS 15 requires a contract with a customer to be legally enforceable and to meet certain criteria to be 
within the scope of the standard and for the general model to apply. It introduces detailed guidance 
on identifying performance obligations which requires entities to determine whether promised goods 
or services are distinct. It also introduces detailed guidance on determining transaction price, including 
guidance on variable consideration and consideration payable to customers. The transaction price will 
then be generally allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to its stand-alone selling 
price. Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue is recognised over time, in a manner that 
best reflects the company’s performance, or at a point in time, when control of the goods or services 
is transferred to the customer.
The standard does not apply to insurance contracts, financial instruments or lease contracts, which 
fall in the scope of other IFRSs. It also does not apply if two companies in the same line of business 
exchange non-monetary assets to facilitate sales to other parties. Furthermore, if a contract with a 
customer is partly in the scope of another IFRS, then the guidance on separation and measurement 
contained in the other IFRS takes precedence.
The Group plans to adopt the standard retrospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with the

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014) (cont’d)
Under the new model, it is possible that more risk management strategies, particularly those involving 
a risk component (other than foreign currency risk) of a non-financial item, will be likely to qualify for 
hedge accounting.
Under IAS 39, for all cash flow hedges, the amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve are 
reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period as the hedged expected 
cash flows affect profit or loss. However, under IFRS 9, for cash flow hedges associated with forecast 
non-financial asset purchases, the amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will instead 
be included directly in the initial cost of the non-financial asset when it is recognised.
The types of hedge accounting relationships that the Group currently designates are expected to meet 
the requirements of IFRS 9 and are aligned with the entity’s risk management strategy and objective.
The Group is still assessing and has not yet reasonably estimated the quantitative impact on its financial 
statements resulting from the new hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9.
 
 
The amendment is not applicable to the Company.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 
Revenue, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real 
Estate, IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers and SIC-31 Revenue – Barter Transactions Involving 
Advertising Services
The new standard introduces a new and more comprehensive revenue recognition model for contracts 
with customers which specifies that revenue should be recognised when (or as) a company transfers 
control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which the company expects to be entitled.
IFRS 15 requires a contract with a customer to be legally enforceable and to meet certain criteria to be 
within the scope of the standard and for the general model to apply. It introduces detailed guidance 
on identifying performance obligations which requires entities to determine whether promised goods 
or services are distinct. It also introduces detailed guidance on determining transaction price, including 
guidance on variable consideration and consideration payable to customers. The transaction price will 
then be generally allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to its stand-alone selling 
price. Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue is recognised over time, in a manner that 
best reflects the company’s performance, or at a point in time, when control of the goods or services 
is transferred to the customer.
The standard does not apply to insurance contracts, financial instruments or lease contracts, which 
fall in the scope of other IFRSs. It also does not apply if two companies in the same line of business 
exchange non-monetary assets to facilitate sales to other parties. Furthermore, if a contract with a 
customer is partly in the scope of another IFRS, then the guidance on separation and measurement 
contained in the other IFRS takes precedence.
The Group plans to adopt the standard retrospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with the 
cumulative effect of initially applying it recognised at the date of initial application (“cumulative effect 
method”). The Group is currently assessing the potential impact on its financial statements resulting 
from the application of IFRS 15.

IFRIC-22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
The interpretation clarifies that the transaction date to be used for translation for foreign currency 
transactions involving an advance payment or receipt is the date on which the entity initially recognises 
the prepayment or deferred income arising from the advance consideration. For transactions involving 
multiple payments or receipts, each payment or receipt gives rise to a separate transaction date. The 
interpretation applies when an entity pays or receives consideration in a foreign currency and recognises 
a non-monetary asset or liability before recognising the related item.

Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment in relation to the classification and 
measurement of share-based payment transactions.
The amendments address three main areas:
• 
The effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment 
transaction. The amendments clarify that the approach used to account for vesting conditions when 
measuring equity-settled share-based payments also applies to cash-settled share-based payments.
• 
The classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding 
tax obligations. This amendment adds an exception to address the narrow situation where the net 
settlement arrangement is designed to meet an entity’s obligation under tax laws or regulations to 
withhold a certain amount in order to meet the employee’s tax obligation associated with the share-
based payment. This amount is then transferred, normally in cash, to the tax authorities on the 
employee’s behalf. To fulfil this obligation, the terms of the share-based payment arrangement may 
permit or require the entity to withhold the number of equity instruments that are equal to the monetary 
value of the employee’s tax obligation from the total number of equity instruments that otherwise would 
have been issued to the employee upon exercise (or vesting) of the share-based payment (‘net share 
settlement feature’). Where transactions meet the criteria, they are not divided into two components 
but are classified in their entirety as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, if they would 
have been so classified in the absence of the net share settlement feature.
• 
The accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction 
changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled. The amendment clarifies that, if the terms 
and conditions of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modified, with the result that it 
becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, the transaction is accounted for as an 
equity-settled transaction from the date of the modification. Any difference (whether a debit or a credit) 
between the carrying amount of the liability derecognised and the amount recognised in equity on the 
modification date is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

The amendments clarify that an entity that is a venture capital organisation, or other qualifying entity, 
may elect, at initial recognition on an investment-by-investment basis, to measure its investments in 
associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss.
If an entity that is not itself an investment entity has an interest in an associate or joint venture that is

measurement applied by that investment entity associate or joint venture to the investment entity 
associate’s or joint venture’s interests in subsidiaries. This election is made separately for each investment

(c) the investment entity associate or joint venture first becomes a parent.

IFRS 16 Leases supersedes IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations 
The new standard introduces a single lease accounting model for lessees under which all major leases 
are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position, removing the lease classification test. Lease 
accounting for lessors essentially remains unchanged except for a number of details including the 
application of the new lease definition, new sale-and-leaseback guidance, new sub-lease guidance and 
new disclosure requirements. Practical expedients and targeted reliefs were introduced including an 
optional lessee exemption for short-term leases (leases with a term of 12 months or less) and low-value 
items, as well as the permission of portfolio-level accounting instead of applying the requirements to 
individual leases. New estimates and judgemental thresholds that affect the identification, classification 
and measurement of lease transactions, as well as requirements to reassess certain key estimates and 
judgements at each reporting date were introduced.
Early application is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 at or before the date of initial application

measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax 
treatments.
Under the interpretation, whether the amounts recorded in the financial statements will differ to that 
in the tax return, and whether the uncertainty is disclosed or reflected in the measurement, depends 
on whether it is probable that the tax authority will accept the entity’s chosen tax treatment. If it is not 
probable that the tax authority will accept the entity’s chosen tax treatment, the uncertainty is reflected 
using the measure that provides the better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty – either 
the most likely amount or the expected value. The interpretation also requires the reassessment of 
judgements and estimates applied if facts and circumstances change – e.g. as a result of examination 
or action by tax authorities, following changes in tax rules or when a tax authority’s right to challenge 
a treatment expires.
The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2019. Earlier application 
is permitted.
• 
Amendments to IAS 19 Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement 
The amendments clarify that on amendment, curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan, a 
company now uses updated actuarial assumptions to determine its current service cost and net interest 
for the period and the effect of the asset ceiling is disregarded when calculating the gain or loss on any 
settlement of the plan and is dealt with separately in other comprehensive income.
The amendments apply for plan amendments, curtailments or settlements that occur on or after the 
beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins on or after 1 May 2019. Earlier application is 
permitted.

IFRS 16 Leases supersedes IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations 
The new standard introduces a single lease accounting model for lessees under which all major leases 
are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position, removing the lease classification test. Lease 
accounting for lessors essentially remains unchanged except for a number of details including the 
application of the new lease definition, new sale-and-leaseback guidance, new sub-lease guidance and 
new disclosure requirements. Practical expedients and targeted reliefs were introduced including an 
optional lessee exemption for short-term leases (leases with a term of 12 months or less) and low-value 
items, as well as the permission of portfolio-level accounting instead of applying the requirements to 
individual leases. New estimates and judgemental thresholds that affect the identification, classification 
and measurement of lease transactions, as well as requirements to reassess certain key estimates and 
judgements at each reporting date were introduced.
Early application is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 at or before the date of initial application 
of IFRS 16. The Group is assessing the potential impact on its financial statements resulting from the 
application of IFRS 16.

Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle
This cycle of improvements contains amendments to four standards. The following are the amendments 
relevant to the Group:
• 
Previously held interests in a joint operations (Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations and 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements). The amendments clarify that, when an entity obtains control of a 
business that is joint operations, it applies the requirements for a business combination achieved 
in stages, including remeasuring previously held interests in the assets and liabilities of the joint 
operation at fair value. In doing so, the acquirer remeasures its entire previously held interest in 
the joint operation.
An entity applies those amendments to business combinations for which the acquisition date is 
on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 May 2019. 
Earlier application is permitted.
• 
Previously held interests in a joint operations (Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements). The 
amendments clarify that a party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint 
operation constitutes a business as defined in IFRS 3, Business Combinations. The amendments 
clarify that the previously held interests in that joint operations are not remeasured.
An entity applies those amendments to transactions in which it obtains joint control on or after 
the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 May 2019. Earlier 
application is permitted.
• 
Income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity (Amendments 
to IAS 12 Income Taxes). The amendments clarify that all income tax consequences of dividends, 
including payments on financial instruments classified as equity, are recognised consistently with 
the transactions that generated the distributable profits (i.e. in profit or loss, OCI or equity).
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2019. Earlier 
application is permitted. When an entity first applies those amendments, it shall apply them to 
the income tax consequences of dividends recognised on or after the beginning of the earliest 
comparative period.
• 
Borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation (Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs). The 
amendments clarify that the general borrowings pool used to calculate eligible borrowing 
costs excludes only borrowings that specifically finance qualifying assets that are still under 
development or construction. Borrowings that were intended to specifically finance qualifying 
assets that are now ready for their intended use or sale are included in that general pool.
• 
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate 
or joint venture
The amendments clarify that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transfer to an associate or joint 
venture involves a business as defined in IFRS 3, Business Combinations. Any gain or loss resulting from 
the sale or contribution of assets that does not constitute a business, however, is recognised only to 
the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associate or joint venture. In December 2015, the 
IASB postponed the effective date of this amendment indefinitely pending the outcome of its research 
project on the equity method of accounting.

Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment features with negative compensation 
Under IFRS 9, a debt instrument can be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, provided that the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding’ (the SPPI criterion) and the instrument is held within the 
appropriate business model for that classification. The amendments to IFRS 9 clarify that a financial 
asset passes the SPPI criterion regardless of the event or circumstance that causes the early termination 
of the contract and irrespective of which party pays or receives reasonable compensation for the 
early termination of the contract. The basis for conclusions to the amendments clarified that the early 
termination can result from a contractual term or from an event outside the control of the parties to the 
contract, such as a change in law or regulation leading to the early termination of the contract.
• 
Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term interests in associate and joint ventures
The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 to long-term interests in an associate or joint 
venture to which the equity method is not applied but that, in substance, form part of the net investment 
in the associate or joint venture (long-term interests). This clarification is relevant because it implies that 
the expected credit loss model in IFRS 9 applies to such long-term interests.
The Board also clarified that, in applying IFRS 9, an entity does not take account of any losses of the 
associate or joint venture, or any impairment losses on the net investment, recognised as adjustments 
to the net investment in the associate or joint venture that arise from applying IAS 28.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2019. Earlier application 
is permitted.

The overall objective of IFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more

In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local 
accounting policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all 
relevant accounting aspects. The core of IFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:
• 
A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach)
• 
A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts

• 
A Contractual Service Margin (CSM) that is equal and opposite to any day one gain in the fulfilment

• 
Certain changes in the expected present value of future cash flows are adjusted against the CSM 
and thereby recognised in profit or loss over the remaining contractual service period
• 
The effect of changes in discount rates will be reported in either profit or loss or other 
comprehensive income, determined by an accounting policy choice
• 
The presentation of insurance revenue and insurance service expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income based on the concept of services provided during the period
• 
Amounts that the policyholder will always receive, regardless of whether an insured event 
happens (non-distinct investment components) are not presented in the income statement, but 
are recognised directly on the balance sheet
• 
Insurance services results (earned revenue less incurred claims) are presented separately from 
the insurance finance income or expense
• 
Extensive disclosures to provide information on the recognised amounts from insurance 
contracts and the nature and extent of risks arising from these contracts
IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods starting on or after 1 May 2021, with comparative figures

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (cont’d)
The main features of the new accounting model for insurance contracts are as follows:
• 
The measurement of the present value of future cash flows, incorporating an explicit risk 
adjustment, remeasured every reporting period (the fulfilment cash flows)
• 
A Contractual Service Margin (CSM) that is equal and opposite to any day one gain in the fulfilment 
cash flows of a group of contracts, representing the unearned profit of the insurance contracts 
to be recognised in profit or loss over the service period (i.e., coverage period)
• 
Certain changes in the expected present value of future cash flows are adjusted against the CSM 
and thereby recognised in profit or loss over the remaining contractual service period
• 
The effect of changes in discount rates will be reported in either profit or loss or other 
comprehensive income, determined by an accounting policy choice
• 
The presentation of insurance revenue and insurance service expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income based on the concept of services provided during the period
• 
Amounts that the policyholder will always receive, regardless of whether an insured event 
happens (non-distinct investment components) are not presented in the income statement, but 
are recognised directly on the balance sheet

Management believes that the Group has control over DTMTDI since it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over DMTDI. 
(c) In connection with the 27 June 2017 Settlement Agreement which resulted to the dismissal of the license dispute filed with the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern District of New York in December 2013, DMFI and Fresh Del Monte (FDP) entered into four joint venture 
agreements. To effect these joint ventures, the Group incorporated its subsidiary, Del Monte Ventures, LLC on 21 June 2017 which 
acquired interests in four joint venture entities which were all incorporated in the state of Delaware, USA. These joint ventures will pursue 
sales of expanded refrigerated offerings across all distribution and sales channels, and will establish a new retail food and beverage 
concept. These joint ventures will initially focus on the U.S. market, with the potential for expansion into other territories. These joint 
venture entities are in their pre-operating stages and have no material assets or liabilities as of 30 April 2018.

The Company regularly reassesses whether it controls an investee when facts and circumstances indicate that 
there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed in Note 4. The Company determined 
that it exercised control on all its subsidiaries as it has all elements of control.
In fiscal year 2015, the Group deconsolidated its subsidiary, Del Monte Andina C.A., an entity which has 
operations in Venezuela. Venezuela has a hyperinflationary economy. The Venezuelan exchange control 
regulations have resulted in other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan Bolivar and 
US Dollar. This has restricted the Venezuelan entity’s ability to pay dividends and obligations denominated in US 
Dollars. The exchange regulations, combined with other recent Venezuelan regulations, have constrained the 
Venezuelan entity’s ability to maintain normal production. Due to the Group’s inability to effectively control the 
operations of the entity, the Group deconsolidated the subsidiary with effect from February 2015. The equity 
interest in this entity is determined to be the cost of investment of the entity at the date of deconsolidation. 
The investment is carried at cost less impairment losses. 
Source of estimation uncertainty
When the subsidiary has suffered recurring operating losses, a test is made to assess whether the interests in 
subsidiary has suffered any impairment by determining the recoverable amount. This determination requires 
significant judgement and estimation. An estimate is made of the future profitability, cash flow, financial health 
and near-term business outlook of the subsidiary, including factors such as market demand and performance. 
The recoverable amount will differ from these estimates as a result of differences between assumptions used 
and actual operations.

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES (CONT’D)
Source of estimation uncertainty
When the joint venture has suffered recurring operating losses, a test is made to assess whether the investment 
in joint venture has suffered any impairment by determining the recoverable amount. This determination 
requires significant judgement and estimation. An estimate is made of the future profitability, cash flow, 
financial health and near-term business outlook of the joint venture, including factors such as market demand 
and performance. The recoverable amount will differ from these estimates as a result of differences between 
assumptions used and actual operations.
Since its acquisition, the Indian sub-continent trademark and the investment in FFPL were allocated to the 
Indian sub-continent cash-generating unit (“Indian sub-continent CGU”). The recoverable amount of Indian 
sub-continent CGU was estimated using the discounted cash flows based on five-year cash flow projections.
Key assumptions used in discounted cash flow projection calculations
Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, revenue growth rates, 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin and terminal value growth rate. 
The values assigned to the key assumptions represented management’s assessment of future trends in the 
industries and were based on both external and internal sources.

In fiscal year 2018, discount rate is a pre-tax measure estimated based on past experience, and industry average 
weighted-average cost of capital, which is based on a possible rate of debt leveraging of 15.7% (2017: 14.7%) 
at a market interest rate of 9.5% (2017: 9.7%).
Revenue growth rate is expressed as compound annual growth rates in the initial five years of the plan. In 
the first year of the business plan, revenue growth rate was projected at 18% (2017: 15%) based on the near-
term business plan and market demand. The annual revenue growth included in the cash flow projections for 
four years was projected at the growth rate based on the historical growth in volume and prices and industry 
growth.
A long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined based on management’s estimate of the long-
term compound annual growth rate in the Indian economy which management believed was consistent with 
the assumption that a market participant would make.
EBITDA margin has been a factor of the revenue forecast based on business plan and market demand coupled 
with the cost saving initiatives.

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The estimated recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount of interest in joint venture and trademark and 
accordingly no impairment loss is recorded.
Management has identified that a reasonably possible change in two key assumptions could cause the 
carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows the amount by which these 
two assumptions would need to change individually for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the

Budgeted EBITDA was estimated taking into account past experience adjusted as follows:
• 
Revenue growth was projected taking into account the average growth levels experienced over the past 
five years and estimated sales volume and price growth for the next five years. It was assumed that sales 
price would increase in line with forecast inflation over the next five years.
• 
The amounts are probability-weighted. 
Fair value less costs of disposal
Fair value less costs of disposal is determined using the market approach, which makes use of prices and other 
relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar companies.
The Market Comparable Method was used in applying the Market Approach, making use of market price data 
of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business as that of DMFI and its subsidiaries. Stocks of 
these companies are traded in a free and open market or in private transactions. The process involves the 
identification of comparable companies, calculation and application of market multiples representing ratios 
of invested capital or equity to financial measures of DMFI and its subsidiaries, application of an appropriate 
control premium to the companies being compared, and adjustment for any non-operating assets or liabilities 
or working capital excess/deficit to arrive at an indication of Business Enterprise Value.
The approach involves the use of both observable inputs and unobservable inputs (e.g. projected revenue and 
EBITDA, and adjusted market multiples). Accordingly, the fair value measurement is categorised under level 3 
of the fair value hierarchy.
Comparable companies were selected from comprehensive lists and directories of public companies in the 
packaged foods industry. Potential comparable companies were analysed based on various factors, including, 
but not limited to, industry similarity, financial risk, company size, geographic diversification, profitability, growth 
characteristics, financial data availability, and active trading volume. The following comparable companies 
were selected:
• 
B&G Foods Inc.
• 
Campbell Soup Company
• 
ConAgra Foods, Inc.
• 
General Mills, Inc.
• 
Hormel Foods Corporation
• 
Seneca Foods Corp.
• 
Treehouse Foods, Inc.
Calculation of the market multiples considered Market Value of Invested Capital (MVIC), the sum of the market 
values of a comparable company’s common stock, interest-bearing debt and preferred stock, assuming that 
the book value of the comparable companies’ debt approximated the market value of the debt. Adjustments to 
the market multiples were made to reflect the difference between the estimated size of DMFI and its subsidiaries 
and each comparable company, improving comparability based on relative size difference prospects. Relative 
size adjustment factors were calculated based on a regression of a Price / Earnings ratio using size as an 
independent variable. The market multiples selected and applied to the DMFI and its subsidiaries’ financial

EBITDA, and adjusted market multiples). Accordingly, the fair value measurement is categorised under level 3 
of the fair value hierarchy.
Comparable companies were selected from comprehensive lists and directories of public companies in the 
packaged foods industry. Potential comparable companies were analysed based on various factors, including, 
but not limited to, industry similarity, financial risk, company size, geographic diversification, profitability, growth 
characteristics, financial data availability, and active trading volume. The following comparable companies 
were selected:
• 
B&G Foods Inc.
• 
Campbell Soup Company
• 
ConAgra Foods, Inc.
• 
General Mills, Inc.
• 
Hormel Foods Corporation
• 
Seneca Foods Corp.
• 
Treehouse Foods, Inc.
Calculation of the market multiples considered Market Value of Invested Capital (MVIC), the sum of the market 
values of a comparable company’s common stock, interest-bearing debt and preferred stock, assuming that 
the book value of the comparable companies’ debt approximated the market value of the debt. Adjustments to 
the market multiples were made to reflect the difference between the estimated size of DMFI and its subsidiaries 
and each comparable company, improving comparability based on relative size difference prospects. Relative 
size adjustment factors were calculated based on a regression of a Price / Earnings ratio using size as an 
independent variable. The market multiples selected and applied to the DMFI and its subsidiaries’ financial 
results in the analysis were as follows:

Sensitivity analysis
Management has identified that a reasonably possible change in the market multiples could cause the carrying 
amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows the amount to which the market 
multiples would need to change independently for the estimated recoverable amount of the DMFI CGU to be 
equal to its carrying amount.

Source of estimation uncertainty
Goodwill and the indefinite life trademarks are assessed for impairment annually. The impairment assessment 
requires an estimation of the VIU and fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU to which the goodwill and 
indefinite life trademarks are allocated.
Estimating the VIU requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU 
and apply an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Actual 
cash flows will differ from these estimates as a result of differences between assumptions used and actual 
operations.
Estimating fair value less costs of disposal requires the Group to calculate market multiples, derived from 
market price data of comparable companies, to be applied to the Group’s financial measures. The estimated 
fair value would change depending on the assumptions used, such as the annual revenue growth rate, EBITDA 
margin, and adjusted market multiples.

The total amount of potential income tax consequences that would arise from the payment of cash dividends 
by a subsidiary to the Company, on the total retained earnings as at 30 April 2018, is approximately US$14.4 
million (30 April 2017: US$8.5 million). 
In 2017, no provision has been made in respect of this potential income tax as it is the Company’s intention to 
reinvest these reserves and not to distribute them as dividends.
In 2018, the Group plans to declare stock dividends from the excess reserves. No provision has been made 
because stock dividends are exempt from tax.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised with respect to the following items.

The tax losses will expire in 2019 and 2020. The tax carry forwards will expire between 2024 and 2027. Deferred 
tax assets have not been recognised with respect to these items because it is not probable that future taxable 
profits will be available to utilise the benefits.
Sources of estimation uncertainty
As of 30 April 2018, deferred tax assets amounting to US$119.6 million (30 April 2017: US$138.3 million) have 
been recognised in respect of the tax loss carry forwards because management assessed that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which DMFI can utilise these benefits. Management expects

The total amount of potential income tax consequences that would arise from the payment of cash dividends 
by a subsidiary to the Company, on the total retained earnings as at 30 April 2018, is approximately US$14.4 
million (30 April 2017: US$8.5 million). 
In 2017, no provision has been made in respect of this potential income tax as it is the Company’s intention to 
reinvest these reserves and not to distribute them as dividends.
In 2018, the Group plans to declare stock dividends from the excess reserves. No provision has been made 
because stock dividends are exempt from tax.

The tax losses will expire in 2019 and 2020. The tax carry forwards will expire between 2024 and 2027. Deferred 
tax assets have not been recognised with respect to these items because it is not probable that future taxable 
profits will be available to utilise the benefits.
Sources of estimation uncertainty
As of 30 April 2018, deferred tax assets amounting to US$119.6 million (30 April 2017: US$138.3 million) have 
been recognised in respect of the tax loss carry forwards because management assessed that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which DMFI can utilise these benefits. Management expects 
profitable growth coming from revenue strategies and cost efficiencies in the future. To the extent that 
profitable growth does not materialise in the future periods, net deferred tax assets of DMFI of US$77.8 million 
may not be realised. The majority of the tax loss for 30 April 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely and tax

approximating those at year end less estimated point-of-sale costs.
Risk Management strategy related to agricultural activities
(i) 
Regulatory and environmental risks
The Group is subject to laws and regulations in the Philippines in which it operates its agricultural 
activities. The Group has established environmental policies and procedures aimed at compliance with 
local environmental and other laws. 
(ii) 
Supply and demand risks
The Group is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the price and sales volume of pineapples and 
papayas. When possible, the Group manages this risk by aligning its harvest volume to market supply 
and demand. Management performs regular industry trend analyses for projected harvest volumes and 
pricing. 
(iii) 
Climate and other risks
The Group’s pineapple plantations are exposed to the risk of damage from climate changes, diseases, 
forest fires, flood, and other natural forces. To manage these risks, the Group develops and executes 
a long-term strategic plan and annual operating plan, supported by a contingency plan and risk 
management measures ensuring business continuity should there be a natural catastrophe. The Group 
is also insured against natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. 
Source of estimation uncertainty
The fair values of the harvested pineapple fruits are based on the most reliable estimate of selling prices, in both 
local and international markets at the point of harvest, as determined by the Group. For the pineapple variety 
being sold as fresh fruits, the market price is based on the selling price of fresh fruits as sold in the local and 
international markets. For the pineapple variety being processed as cased goods, the market price is derived 
from average sales price of the processed product adjusted for margin related to further processing. Changes 
in fair values of agricultural produce after initial recognition are included in the carrying amount of cased 
goods at the reporting date.
The fair values of the growing pineapple crops are based on the most reliable estimate of market prices, in 
both local and international markets at the point of harvest, as determined by the Group. Fair value is initially 
recognised when the pineapple fruit develops when the bearer plant has reached maturity to bear fruit. The fair 
value is approximated by the estimated selling price at point of harvest less future growing costs to be incurred 
until harvest. Such future growing costs decreases as the growing crops near the point of harvest.

INVENTORIES (CONT’D)
Source of estimation uncertainty
The Group recognises allowance on inventory obsolescence when inventory items are identified as obsolete. 
Obsolescence is based on the physical and internal condition of inventory items. Obsolescence is also 
established when inventory items are no longer marketable. Obsolete goods when identified are charged to 
income statement and are written off. In addition to an allowance for specifically identified obsolete inventory, 
estimation is made on a group basis based on the age of the inventory items. The Group believes such 
estimates represent a fair charge of the level of inventory obsolescence in a given year. The Group reviews on a 
monthly basis the condition of its inventory. The assessment of the condition of the inventory either increases 
or decreases the expenses or total inventory.
Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates 
are made of the amount the inventories expected to be realised. These estimates take into consideration 
fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after reporting date to the extent that such 
events confirm conditions existing at the reporting date. 
The Group reviews on a continuous basis the product movement, changes in customer demands and 
introductions of new products to identify inventories which are to be written down to the net realisable values. 
The write-down of inventories is reviewed periodically to reflect the accurate valuation in the financial records. 
An increase in write-down of inventories would increase the recorded cost of sales and operating expenses 
and decrease current assets.

INVENTORIES (CONT’D)
Source of estimation uncertainty
The Group recognises allowance on inventory obsolescence when inventory items are identified as obsolete. 
Obsolescence is based on the physical and internal condition of inventory items. Obsolescence is also 
established when inventory items are no longer marketable. Obsolete goods when identified are charged to 
income statement and are written off. In addition to an allowance for specifically identified obsolete inventory, 
estimation is made on a group basis based on the age of the inventory items. The Group believes such 
estimates represent a fair charge of the level of inventory obsolescence in a given year. The Group reviews on a 
monthly basis the condition of its inventory. The assessment of the condition of the inventory either increases 
or decreases the expenses or total inventory.
Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates 
are made of the amount the inventories expected to be realised. These estimates take into consideration 
fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after reporting date to the extent that such 
events confirm conditions existing at the reporting date. 
The Group reviews on a continuous basis the product movement, changes in customer demands and 
introductions of new products to identify inventories which are to be written down to the net realisable values. 
The write-down of inventories is reviewed periodically to reflect the accurate valuation in the financial records. 
An increase in write-down of inventories would increase the recorded cost of sales and operating expenses 
and decrease current assets.

NONCURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
The Group classifies noncurrent assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The criteria are reviewed periodically if still met, 
otherwise revert back to property, plant and equipment.
In 2017, several assets were sold resulting in a gain of US$0.3 million recognised in “Other income (expenses) 
– net” in the income statement of the Group. The remaining unsold assets amounting to US$0.7 million have 
been reclassified out of assets held for sale and back to property, plant and equipment.
In 2018, management committed to a plan to sell certain assets of the Group’s Plymouth, Indiana plant. 
Additionally, an office building in Siloam Springs, Arkansas was vacated and put up for sale. Accordingly, these 
assets were presented as assets held for sale. Efforts to sell the assets have started and a sale was expected 
within twelve months from the date of reclassification.

LOANS AND BORROWINGS (CONT’D)
Principal Payments. The First Lien term loan generally requires quarterly scheduled principal payments of 
0.25% of the outstanding principal per quarter from 30 April 2014 to 31 January 2021. The balance is due 
in full on the maturity date of 18 February 2021. Scheduled principal payments with respect to the First 
Lien term loan are subject to reduction following any mandatory or voluntary prepayments on terms and 
conditions set forth in the First Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
The Second Lien term loan is due in full at its maturity date of 18 August 2021. 
The Term Loan Credit Agreements also require DMFI to prepay outstanding loans under the First Lien term 
loan and the Second Lien term loan, subject to certain exceptions, with, among other things:
• 
50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if the leverage ratio is 4.0x or less and to 0% if the 
leverage ratio is 3.0x or less) of the annual excess cash flow, as defined in the First Lien Term Loan Credit 
Agreement;
• 
100% of the net cash proceeds of certain casualty events and non-ordinary course asset sales or other 
dispositions of property for a purchase price above US$2.0 million, in each case, subject to DMFI’s right 
to reinvest the proceeds; and
• 
100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted 
under the First Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement.
On 14 March 2018, the Company, a trust owned by DMFHII and certain seller lenders entered into a Purchase 
Agreement wherein the Company, or its designated affiliate, agreed to purchase certain Second Lien term 
loans from the seller lenders at an amount equal to 70% of the principal amount of the loans to be sold, plus 
accrued and unpaid interest thereon. On 27 March 2018, DMFI, DMFHI and the lenders signed the second 
amendment to the Second Lien term loan allowing the Company, or its eligible assignee, to purchase any and 
all loans outstanding under the amended agreement which were duly submitted by the lenders for purchase 
at a price equal to 70% of the principal amount.
In March 2018, DMFHII, the affiliate assignee, through a trust, purchased DMFI’s Second Lien term loans with 
principal amount of US$125.9 million from seller lenders for US$88.2 million. The pre-tax net gain from the 
purchase of the loans amounting to US$33.6 million, net of transaction costs amounting to US$3.2 million, 
was recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements and is presented under “Finance income” in 
the consolidated income statement. The non-controlling interests of DMPLFL agreed to waive its share in any 
economic benefits arising from the Group’s purchase of the Second Lien term loans. DMFHII agreed to make 
an equity contribution to DMFI in the amount equivalent to the interest received from DMFI. 
To finance the purchase of the Second Lien term loans, the Company extended a loan to DMFHII amounting 
to US$88.2 million. Such loan is subject to interest of 12.95%, subject to quarterly repricing, and will mature on 
18 August 2021. The interest income earned by the Company on this loan amounted to US$1.0 million in 2018.
Ability to Incur Additional Indebtedness. DMFI has the right to request an additional US$100 million plus an 
additional amount of secured indebtedness under the First Lien term loan and the Second Lien term loan. 
Lenders under this facility are under no obligation to provide any such additional loans, and any such borrowings 
will be subject to customary conditions precedent, including satisfaction of a prescribed leverage ratio, subject 
to the identification of willing lenders and other customary conditions precedent.

The DMFI Plan (cont’d)
The second part is an arrangement which provides for grandfathered and suspended hourly participants a 
traditional pension benefit based upon service, final average compensation, and age at termination. This plan 
was frozen since 31 December 1995, which the active participation of certain participants was grandfathered 
and the active participation of other participants was suspended. 
DMFI currently meets and plans to continue to meet the minimum funding levels required under local legislation, 
which imposes certain consequences on DMFI’s defined benefit plan if it does not meet the minimum funding 
levels. DMFI has not made any contributions during the year.
DMFI does not expect to make contributions to the plan in 2019.

The DMFI Plan (cont’d)
The second part is an arrangement which provides for grandfathered and suspended hourly participants a 
traditional pension benefit based upon service, final average compensation, and age at termination. This plan 
was frozen since 31 December 1995, which the active participation of certain participants was grandfathered 
and the active participation of other participants was suspended. 
DMFI currently meets and plans to continue to meet the minimum funding levels required under local legislation, 
which imposes certain consequences on DMFI’s defined benefit plan if it does not meet the minimum funding 
levels. DMFI has not made any contributions during the year.
DMFI does not expect to make contributions to the plan in 2019.

During fiscal year 2016, a change to the post-retirement benefits plan of certain non-union employees 
were made where current retiree medical and dental benefits were replaced for contributions to a health 
reimbursement arrangement (HRA) account. As a result of the plan amendment, the Group’s defined benefit 
obligation decreased by US$40.7 million. A corresponding reduction against past service cost was recognised 
as part of “General and administrative expenses” account in the 2016 income statement of the Group.

The BOD of DMFI reviews the level of funding required for the retirement fund. Such a review includes the 
asset-liability matching (ALM) strategy and investment risk management policy. DMFI’s ALM objective is to 
match maturities of the plan assets to the retirement benefit obligation as they fall due. The Group monitors 
how the duration and expected yield of the investments match the expected cash outflows arising from the 
retirement benefit obligation.
DMFI’s investment objectives are to ensure that the assets of its qualified defined benefit plan are invested to 
provide an optimal rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio, consistent with the assumption 
of a reasonable risk level, and to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plan’s benefit obligations 
as they become due. 
DMFI believes that a well-diversified investment portfolio, including both equity and fixed income components, 
will result in the highest attainable investment return with an acceptable level of overall risk. DMFI’s investment 
policies and procedures are designed to ensure that the plan’s investments are in compliance with the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONT’D)
The BOD of DMFI approves the percentage of asset to be allocated for fixed income instruments and equities. 
The retirement plan has set maximum exposure limits for each type of permissible investments in marketable 
securities and deposit instruments. The BOD of DMFI may, from time to time, in the exercise of its reasonable 
discretion and taking into account existing investment opportunities, review and revise such allocation and 
limits.
Source of estimation uncertainty
Pension expense and pension assets/liabilities are determined using certain actuarial estimates and assumptions 
relating to the discount rate used in valuing the subsidiary’s defined benefit obligations and future experiences 
such as the rate of return on plan assets, future salary increases, retirement date or age, mortality, and turnover 
rate of covered employees. These estimates and assumptions directly influence the amount of the pension 
assets/liabilities and expense recognised in the financial statements.
Sensitivity analysis
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following 
table summarises how the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of reporting period would have 
increased (decreased) as a result of a change in the respective assumptions by the respective percentages 
below.

The above sensitivities are based on the average duration of the benefit obligation determined at the date of 
the last full actuarial valuation at 30 April 2018 and are applied to adjust the defined benefit obligation at the 
end of the report period for the assumptions concerned. Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full 
distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the 
assumption shown.

DMPI’s core production operations in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines is under Philippine Packing Agricultural 
Export Processing Zone. This new zone has been established in accordance with the policies of the Philippine 
Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). DMPI enjoys certain fiscal and non-fiscal incentives including a 5% (2017 
and 2016: 5%) tax on gross profit in lieu of the statutory 30% (2017 and 2016: 30%) on profit before tax, duty 
free importation of capital equipment, raw materials and supplies used in pursuit of its Ecozone-registered 
activities, among other incentives. The incentives will be available for as long as DMPI complies with the PEZA’s 
requirements which includes exporting 70% of its production. This current tax incentive expired in fiscal year 
2018 and was extended for an additional three years ending fiscal year 2021.
DMPI has received the PEZA approval for a second zone, the Bukidnon Agro-Resources Export Zone, for agri-
development projects. This current tax incentive expired in fiscal year 2018 and was extended for an additional 
three years ending fiscal year 2021.
On 22 December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”). The Act lowered the U.S. 
federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective 1 January 2018. 
Company
There is no tax expense for the Company as the income of the Company is exempt from all income taxes in the 
British Virgin Islands except for ROHQ in the Philippines which has a preferential tax rate of 10%.
Republic Act (RA) No. 1096 or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act (TRAIN) was signed into law 
on 19 December 2017 and took effect 1 January 2018, making the new tax law enacted as of the reporting 
date. Although the TRAIN changes existing tax law and includes several provisions that will generally affect 
businesses on a prospective basis, the management assessed that the same will not have any significant impact 
on the financial statement balances as of the reporting date.

TAX EXPENSE (CREDIT) – NET (CONT’D)
Sources of estimation uncertainty
The Group has exposure to income taxes in several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgement is involved in 
determining the group-wide provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for 
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises 
liabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final 
tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will 
impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

Del Monte Foods Holding Equity Compensation Plan 
The 2014 Equity Compensation Plan (the “2014 Equity Plan”) was adopted by the Board of DMFHI effective 24 
September 2014. The 2014 Equity Plan provided for the grant of stock options to key executives. 9,000,000 
shares of common stock of DMFHI were reserved for grant under the 2014 Equity Plan.
In 2015, DMFHI granted 7,065,000 stock options. The options granted were subject to performance-based and 
service-based vesting and vested annually over 7 years and had a term of 10 years. The grant date fair value of 
these options was US$1.22. As of 30 April 2015, 2,265,000 shares of common stock were available for future 
grant. However, in September 2015, the 2014 Equity Plan was cancelled with none of the granted options 
vested as of the termination of the plan.
In September 2016, the authorised shares reserved for grant under the plan was increased from 9,000,000 
to 15,000,000. As of 30 April 2018 13,577,999 share options (30 April 2017: 12,240,408 share options) were 
available for future grant, respectively.
The fair value for stock options granted was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. This model estimates the fair value of the options based on a number of assumptions, such as expected 
option life, interest rates, the current fair market value and expected volatility of common stock and expected 
dividends. The expected term of options granted was based on the “simplified” method. Expected stock price 
volatility was determined based on the historical volatilities of comparable companies over a historical period 
that matches the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate was based on the expected U.S. 
Treasury rate over the expected life. The dividend yield was based on the expectation that no dividends will be 
paid. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions for performance-based stock options 
granted for the periods indicated:

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is` the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with 
its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.  The Group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or 
risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group maintains a balance between continuity of cash inflows and flexibility in the use of available and 
collateral free credit lines from local and international banks. Currently, the Group excluding DMFI is entitled 
to a total of US$663.9 million (30 April 2017: US$1,120.0 million) in credit lines, of which 29% (30 April 2017: 
43%) remain available. The lines are mostly for short-term financing requirements, with US$57.4 million (30 
April 2017: US$196 million) available for long-term requirements. The Group constantly maintains good 
relations with its banks, such that additional facilities, whether for short or long term requirements, may be 
made available.
The Group is able to increase the commitments under the ABL Facility, subject only to the consent of the 
new or existing lenders providing such increases, such that the aggregate principal amount of commitments 
does not exceed US$450.0 million. The lenders under this facility are under no obligation to provide any such 
additional commitments, and any increase in commitments will be subject to customary conditions precedent. 
Notwithstanding any such increase in the facility size, the Group’s ability to borrow under the facility will remain 
limited at all times by the borrowing base (to the extent the borrowing base is less than the commitments).
The Group has the right to request an additional US$100.0 million plus an additional amount of secured 
indebtedness under the First Lien term loan and the Second Lien term loan. Lenders under this facility are 
under no obligation to provide any such additional loans, and any such borrowings will be subject to customary 
conditions precedent, including satisfaction of a prescribed leverage ratio, subject to the identification of 
willing lenders and other customary conditions precedent.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT’D)
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The currency giving rise to this risk is primarily the US Dollar, 
Mexican Peso and Venezuelan Bolivar.
From time to time, the Group manages its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by 
entering into forward contracts to cover a portion of its projected expenditures paid in foreign currency. The 
Group accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges.
At the reporting date, the Group’s exposure to foreign currencies is as follows:

The Company has no significant exposure to foreign currencies as at 30 April 2018 and 2017.
Sensitivity analysis
A 10% strengthening of the group entities’ foreign currencies against their respective functional currency at the 
reporting date would have increased (decreased) loss/profit before taxation and equity by the amounts shown 
below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
A 10% weakening of the group entities’ foreign currencies against their respective functional currency would 
have the equal but opposite effect on the amounts shown below, on the basis that all other variables remain 
constant.

Commodity price risk
The Group is regularly engaged in the purchase of tinplates and fuel and is significantly exposed to commodity 
price risk related to tinplates and fuel. The Group ensures future supply of tinplates while minimising the 
impact of price movements by purchasing tinplates and fuel in advance of the production requirements. These 
purchase contracts are entered into for the purpose of receipt or delivery of tinplates and fuel in accordance 
with the expected usage requirements of the Group. 
Certain commodities such as diesel fuel and natural gas (collectively, “commodity contracts”) are used in the 
production and transportation of the Group’s products. Generally, these commodities are purchased based 
upon market prices that are established with the vendors as part of the procurement process. The Group 
uses futures, swaps, and swaption or option contracts, as deemed appropriate, to reduce the effect of price 
fluctuations on anticipated purchases. These contracts may have a term of up to 24 months.

A 10% change in commodity prices at the reporting date would have decreased (increased) profit before 
taxation and increased (decreased) equity by the amounts shown below.

Assets 
Valuation technique
Significant unobservable inputs
Noncurrent assets 
held for sale
Market 
comparison 
technique 
and 
cost technique: The valuation model 
considered 
quoted 
market 
prices 
for similar items when available, and 
depreciated 
replacement 
cost 
as 
appropriate.
The 
unobservable 
inputs 
used 
to 
determine the market value are net selling 
prices, sizes, and property location. The 
unobservable inputs used to determine 
replacement costs are purchase price of 
building, land, and furniture and fixtures 
reduced by related selling costs.
Significant increase (decrease) in the significant unobservable inputs of freehold land, livestock, harvested 
crops sold as fresh fruit and harvested crop sold used in processed products would result in higher (lower) 
fair values. Significant increase (decrease) in the estimated future pineapple selling price, gross margin per ton 
and estimated volume of harvest would result in higher (lower) fair value of growing produce, while significant 
increase (decrease) in the future growing costs would result in lower (higher) fair value.

COMMITMENTS
Operating lease commitments
The Group leases certain property, equipment and office and warehouse facilities. At the reporting date, the 
Group have commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as 
follows:
Group

 245,509 
The leases typically run for an initial period of 2 to 25 years, with an option to renew the lease after that date. 
Some of the leases contain escalation clauses but do not provide for contingent rents. Lease terms do not 
contain any restrictions on Group activities concerning dividends, additional debts or further leasing.
Minimum lease payments, recognised as an expense in the Group’s profit or loss for the fiscal years ended 30 
April 2018, 2017 and 2016 amounted to US$62,272, US$64.951 and US$52,141, respectively.
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee
The Group has entered into various lease agreements as a lessee. The Group had determined that the significant 
risks and rewards on properties leased from third parties are retained by the lessors.
